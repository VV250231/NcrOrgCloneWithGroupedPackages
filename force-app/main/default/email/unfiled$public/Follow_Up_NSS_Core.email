<span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Thank you for taking the time to meet with me yesterday. I wanted to send over a few resources about Network Security</span> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;">that speak specifically to small businesses. Here are a couple of great resources that I have found from reputable</span> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;">sources that address the importance of making an investment into a network security strategy:</span><br />

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;">In the first link, I appreciate how they do address the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; issue, they put it in these terms:</span><br />
&nbsp;<i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">&ldquo;It is important to remember that there are costs for protecting information; there are also costs for not protecting information, which will be covered later in the risk topic. The costs for not protecting information can be much higher than those associated with protecting it.&rdquo;</span></i><br />
It is estimated that the cost of a breach can be between $77,000 and $875,000: <a href="http://blog.securitymetrics.com/2016/07/importance-of-pcidss-get-compliant.html"><span style="color:blue;">http://blog.securitymetrics.com/2016/07/importance-of-pcidss-get-compliant.html</span></a><br />
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;">NCR takes network security very serious and for the best protection, as recommended by the above links and PCI compliance, we recommend the following services:</span><br />
<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">1.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A commercial grade Firewall that is</span></span> <b><i><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">managed daily</span></span></i></b><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;"> by NCR</span></span><br />
<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">2.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secure Access &ndash; a PCI compliant remote access tool to log in to the site remotely and also do remote reporting/printing/transfer of files<br />
3.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threat Defender &ndash; an Antivirus and scanning client we install on the actual terminals<br />
4.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100,000 breach assistance coverage</span></span><br />
<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">As I mentioned, if you feel that you are unable to make this investment at this time,</span></span> <span style="color:black;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">it will be important to follow up with your insurance provider to be sure you have security breach insurance.</span></span><br />
<span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">I know I have thrown a lot of information your way, please let me know if you have any questions.</span></span></span> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Thank you for taking the time to meet with me yesterday.
