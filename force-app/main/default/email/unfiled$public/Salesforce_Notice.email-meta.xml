    <subject>Salesforce Notice: Use In-Line Edit to Update Selling Stage to Closed</subject>
    <textOnly>Use In-Line Edit to Update Selling Stage to Closed

If you are updating opportunities to Closed/Booked this afternoon, please use the in-line edit function to update the Selling Stage field to Closed/Booked or Closed/Lost instead of using the Sales Path to mark the stage.

There is a component error that will appear if you try to Close an opportunity using the Sales Path and we are working to resolve. Using the edit function to update the opportunity will allow you to successfully Close the opportunity.


Thank you,
