<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
Iâ€™m following up on my last email regarding your Aloha point of sale. We believe that modernizing your system could help you grow off-premise options, gain visibility into your restaurant, and offer safer dine-in experiences with contactless ordering and payment.<br />
<br />
We actually have a team coming to your area in the next couple of days. We would love to learn more about your restaurant and answer any questions you may have regarding your restaurant technology or the potential benefits of refreshing to Aloha Essentials.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if I can help by setting up an appointment at your restaurant with one of my teammates.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
