<br />
<br />
First of all, we hope this email will find you well, especially during the challenging times. If you allow me, please I would like to introduce myself. I work at NCR with businesses in Telecom &amp; Technology space, supporting many different customers and technologies globally across&nbsp; 160 countries.<br />
<br />
This inspired me to gain a better understanding of how you are handling business strategy and if there is any way we could help you this year to increase your business growth.<br />
In doing so, I noticed a few areas of opportunity and felt compelled to reach out to you directly, and I hope you donâ€™t mind.<br />
Today, we would like to share more with you on&nbsp; SD-WAN services.</span></span></span><br />
