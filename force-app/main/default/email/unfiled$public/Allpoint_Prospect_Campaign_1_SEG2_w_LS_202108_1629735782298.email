<br />
<span style="line-height:normal"><b>Allpoint is a different way to handle your ATM needs</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:normal">For years, financial institutions have managed ATMs by building out their own fleets, refunding surcharges, or joining a network. Allpoint is different. We are a network, yes, but Allpoint manages the network experience for maximum value. Just think about it – other networks may:</span></span></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:normal">Send your cardholders to your competitors’ ATMs – yes, your cardholders use ATMs at other financial institutions where they can be sold on other services </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:normal">Force you to give up surcharge revenue on your own ATMs </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:normal">Not manage the ATM network, providing no guarantees on uptime or availability </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:normal">Deliver an inconsistent user experience </span></span></span></li>
</ul>
