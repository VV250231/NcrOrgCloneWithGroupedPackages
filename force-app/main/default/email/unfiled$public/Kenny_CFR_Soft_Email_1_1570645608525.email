<br />
I recently have stumbled across a very interesting Wall Street Journal article that shines light on the direction of the convenience store and fuel retail industry in the near future. It explains the necessity of the marriage between the convenience industry and technology in the coming years and what that means for retailers looking to increase their customer loyalty and revenue.<br />

<br />
In an ever changing industry, I understand that market leaders must stay on their toes and adapt. Hope you find this information useful!<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
