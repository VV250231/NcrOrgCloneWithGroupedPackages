First of all, we hope this email will find you well, especially during the challenging times. If you allow me, please I would like to introduce myself. I work at NCR with businesses in Telecom &amp; Technology space, supporting many different customers and technologies globally across nearly 180 countries.<br />
<i><u>We already do business with you, and the reason why we are reaching out to you is developing our partnership.</u></i><br />
This inspired me to gain a better understanding of how you are handling business strategy and if there is any way we could help you this year to increase your business growth. In doing so, I noticed a few areas of opportunity and felt compelled to reach out to you directly, and I hope you donâ€™t mind.<br />
We are offering broad multivendor coverage across a variety of technology domains distinguishes us from our competitors. Today, we have active engagements with technology manufacturers spanning routing, switching, wireless, WAN acceleration, unified communications &amp; collaboration, SD-WAN, NFV, end-user services, storage, firewall, Edge Computing, and other domains.<br />
