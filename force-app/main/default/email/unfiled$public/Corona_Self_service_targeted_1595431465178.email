Retailers are looking for additional in-store transaction throughput when staffing may become more difficult. We are committed to helping retailers provide the best solutions for your consumers while keeping them safe in the current times. We believe offerings like these will help us to deliver on this commitment to you and your customers:<br /> <br /> <b>Self-Checkout</b>, improving customer experience while reducing transaction time and staffing issues&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <b>Cash Tender Module</b>, enabling retailers to automate cash handling in their existing POS lanes and their shoppers to make and receive payments directly<br /> <br /> <b>FastLane Mobile Shopper</b>, an end-to-end mobile shopping solution that enables consumers to scan-and-pay as they go with no human interaction &nbsp;<br /> <br /> I’d like to schedule a 15-minute, virtual conversation to learn more about your current business situation and where we may be able to help you in meeting your customers’ demands. How does next Wednesday&nbsp;work? &nbsp;<br /> <br /> Thanks in advance and stay safe,</span></span></span>
