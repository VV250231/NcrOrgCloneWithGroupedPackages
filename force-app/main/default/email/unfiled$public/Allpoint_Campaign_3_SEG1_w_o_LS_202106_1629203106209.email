<span style="line-height:110%">Allpoint+ deposit ATMs are now available for your cardholders!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:110%">Allpoint+ is the first and only retail-based surcharge-free cash deposit network in the U.S.&nbsp; By the end of this year, we expect to have grown it to nearly 2,000 locations, concentrated in major metropolitan areas from coast-to-coast. &nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:110%">Most importantly – Allpoint+ is not a shared network which means you are not sending your cardholders to competitors’ branches. In addition, our new risk-free pricing means you only pay when your cardholders make a deposit.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:110%">The Allpoint Network operations rules mandated that participating financial institution were to enable cash deposits by July 15, 2021. Your cardholders can join the thousands of others who now have easy and convenient access to Allpoint cash deposits; but, you need to first enable your cards.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:110%">Don’t delay. Reach out as soon as you are ready to start you enablement.</span><br />
