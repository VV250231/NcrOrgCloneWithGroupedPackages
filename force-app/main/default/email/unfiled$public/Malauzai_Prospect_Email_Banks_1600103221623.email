  Good Afternoon , 
  <br /> 
  <br /> This is Ryan Schneider with NCR Digital Banking. I noticed it looks like you’re using Malauzai for digital banking – is that correct? 
  <br /> 
  <br /> NCR Digital Banking has brought on numerous clients formerly using Malauzai, and we’re in discussions with more.&nbsp; We consistently hear of Malauzai clients struggling on key fronts below, which are exacerbated by more customers moving to ‘digital preferred’ – see NCR’s thought leadership on this here:

  </ul> 
  <br /> Are you potentially experiencing similar challenges to the below with Malauzai?&nbsp; If so, I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you how NCR can help!&nbsp; Please let me know a good time for us to speak.&nbsp; Looking forward to speaking with you!
