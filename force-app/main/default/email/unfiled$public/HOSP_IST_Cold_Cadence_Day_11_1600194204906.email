  <p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br /> <br /> I have tried to get into contact with you several times over the last few days without success, which leaves me to thinking that:<br /> <br /> A) You’re not interested. That’s OK, I won’t take it personally.<br /> B) It is not a good time. This happens. I’ll happily get back to you in a few weeks, months, or years, although that might be too far of a stretch.<br /> C) You’ve been abducted by aliens; please let them know that I am happy to come along. You can tell them where to find me.<br /> <br /> I will refrain from contacting you. However, if you ever need a POS system, feel free to keep my information on file.<br /> <br /> Thanks!</p>
