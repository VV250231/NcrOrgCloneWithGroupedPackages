    <subject>A new lead has been assigned to you</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName} at {!Lead.Company} may be ready to buy.
This notice may have been triggered to you because the lead has been active on our website or because they spoke with someone at an event or on the phone. Here are your next steps: 
 
Review the Prospect Profiler section in the lead record to see if they have been active on our website.
Review the “notes” field to see if there is any new information gathered from a live event or phone call to help you follow up appropriately.
Change the lead status to “accepted” to accept the lead then follow up immediately. If the lead is pipeline worthy, convert the lead to an opportunity. If it is not pipeline worthy, return it to nurture or disqualify it.
Did you know that you can set up Prospect Profiler to automatically alert you when a lead, contact or un-named visitor from one of your accounts visits ncr.com? Click the following link to view Prospect Profiler training (course 80335) on NCRU to learn how to set up alerts.</textOnly>
