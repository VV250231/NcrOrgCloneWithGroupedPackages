You have a lead that has exceeded the accepted SLA for qualifying/disqualifying/reassigning/returning to nurture.

This means the lead has been sitting in open status without an update for more than 2 days.

Please take action by reviewing your leads on the leads tab in NSC and updating any open leads.
