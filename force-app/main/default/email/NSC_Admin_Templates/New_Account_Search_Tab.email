Salesforce Update:

Due to the integration of contract information via the new Pramata application in Salesforce, there is a NCR legal requirement to restrict Account view access.  As of Friday, April 21, you will only be able to view Accounts that you own or where you are listed as an Account Team member.  
 
In order to provide users an alternate Account view, a new object has been created which will allow a global search based upon customer name or master customer number (MCN).  The new tab is called Account Search.  

Please direct any questions to nsc.administration@ncr.com.

Thank you!
