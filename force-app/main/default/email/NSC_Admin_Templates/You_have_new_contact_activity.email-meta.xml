    <subject>You have new contact activity</subject>
    <textOnly>Your contact {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName} at {!Account.Name} may be ready to buy.
This notice may have been triggered to you because your contact has been active on our website or because they spoke with someone at an event or on the phone. Here are your next steps: 
 
Review the Prospect Profiler section in the contact record to see if they have been active on our website.
Review the “notes” section to see if there is any new information gathered from a live event or phone call to help you follow up appropriately.
Associate the contact to any opportunities in NSC where they play a significant role.
