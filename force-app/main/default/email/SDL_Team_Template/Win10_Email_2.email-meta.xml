    <textOnly>Next Steps for Windows 10 Migration





{!Contact.FirstName},


This is {!Contact.OwnerFirstName} again with NCR. I wanted to remind you that pricing is now available for the Windows 10 Upgrade on your ATM Fleet.


Microsoft is discontinuing all services related to Windows 7 January 14th,2020. The reason we are reaching out now in regards to this is because it takes approximately 12-18 months to complete the migration process.


The next step in this process would be to get a proposal over to you to show the associated costs with this migration. We have a complimentary ATM Fleet Analysis available to develop the best course of action for your specific situation.


Please let me know the best time to speak with you.


Thank you,
