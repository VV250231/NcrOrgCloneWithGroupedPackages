    <textOnly>Hi {!Business_Continuity__c.Contact_Name__c},

There’s no question that the coronavirus pandemic has rocked the restaurant industry and significantly impacted your ability to drive revenue. With social distancing, takeout, and online ordering here to stay, do you have everything you need to provide your guests with a clean, contactless dining experience?


I’d love to set up some time to talk about your strategy for dine-in and how we can create the ideal contactless experience for your guests.


Talk soon,
