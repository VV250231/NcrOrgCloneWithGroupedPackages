"****ALERT*****   

This customer's {!Account.Parent} {!Account.Name} {!Account.Master_Customer_Number__c}  Maintenance bill was billed incorrectly on {!Case.Invoice_Number__c}. This prebill was originally researched and approved for billing by {!Case.OwnerFullName} on Case #{!Case.CaseNumber} in the amount of  #$#. The customer is inquiring due to {!Case.Customer_Inquiry_Reason__c}. I have determined this to be the result of {!Case.Error_Omission__c}. This is being sent to you as the Supervisor and the person who originally worked the prebill for future prevention and better customer satisfaction.

The new resolution will be worked under {!Case.CaseNumber}.
