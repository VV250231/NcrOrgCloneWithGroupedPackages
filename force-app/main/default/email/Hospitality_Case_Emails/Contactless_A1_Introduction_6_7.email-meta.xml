    <textOnly>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},

It’s no secret that the coronavirus pandemic has rocked the restaurant industry. Customer expectations have changed, and we believe contactless interactions, takeout and digital ordering are here to stay. If you need help supporting these new operations, I would be happy to set up some time to talk about your strategy and how we can help you create contactless experiences for your guests.

Talk soon,
