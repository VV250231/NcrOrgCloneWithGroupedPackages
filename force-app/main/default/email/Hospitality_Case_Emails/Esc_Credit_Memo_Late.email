"*****ALERT******   

The dispute case # {!Case.CaseNumber} that was logged on {!Case.ClosedDate} as a {!Case.Dispute_Type__c} is LATE. This Credit is currently showing #dayslate# and the customer is inquiring about it.  (60 days past prior case close date- today's date)   I am notifying you as the original case worker, {!Case.OwnerFullName} and our supervisor #Supervisor name# for follow-up and awareness of this SLA miss with the customer. 
I have closed my case and sent the "Credit Memo Late" message to the customer.   Further updates should come from you on the original case #{!Case.CaseNumber}, which I have marked as High Importance.
