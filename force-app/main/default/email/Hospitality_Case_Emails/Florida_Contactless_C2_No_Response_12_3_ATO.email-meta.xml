    <textOnly>Hi {!Business_Continuity__c.Contact_Name__c},

From curbside pickup to dine-in experiences, restaurants have to adapt how they operate. Brands that embrace change will win.  To help, we’re adding new features to Aloha’s online ordering capabilities that enable you to use the same technology for your takeout/curbside pickup and contactless dine-in experiences.



Please let me know if you would like to set up a call. If now isn’t the right time, you can learn about everything contactless for restaurants on our website.



Talk soon,
