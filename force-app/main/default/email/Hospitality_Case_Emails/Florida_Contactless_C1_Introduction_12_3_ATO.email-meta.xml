    <textOnly>Hi {!Business_Continuity__c.Contact_Name__c},

Social distancing and the need to limit person-to-person contact is here to stay, and I just wanted to let you know that I’m here to help.

According to a new survey from Mastercard, 8 out of 10 consumers see contactless as a cleaner way of payment. We have new contactless payment capabilities available now with Aloha and more coming soon. Are you interested in learning more about contactless dining best practices?

I would be happy to set up some time to talk about your strategy and how we can create the ideal contactless experience for your guests.

Talk soon,
