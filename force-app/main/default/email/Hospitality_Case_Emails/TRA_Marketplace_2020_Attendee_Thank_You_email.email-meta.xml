    <textOnly>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},

Thank you for visiting us virtually at TRA Marketplace! We hope you were able to learn a lot throughout the week and were able to catch our video that highlighted some of Aloha’s contactless dine-in solutions. I would be happy to speak with you about your in-store operations strategy if converting everything to contactless is top-of-mind, or if you only want a contactless way to pay, we can help with that too.

I’d also be happy to speak with you about any other challenges you may be facing including consolidating orders from multiple sources, managing delivery, or re-engaging customers to rebuild business momentum. 

Let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like to set up a phone call so I can learn more about your restaurant.

Thanks,
{{{Sender.Name}}}</textOnly>
