    <subject>Run a Shell Station? You’ll Want to See This</subject>
    <textOnly>If you’re like many Shell operators, you’re constantly looking for smarter ways to run your c-store.

You want to see faster returns on the money you’ve invested. And you want to make your job easier.

NCR can help, with three solutions that are certified for Shell:

NCR RPOS. 45% of c-store shoppers are in and out in 3 minutes. Your store needs a completely connected platform that speeds up everything. See how to gain agility with RPOS. &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/retail/convenience-fuel-retail/shell?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=Other&amp;utm_campaign=2021_March_MajorOilShellCampaign_Retail&amp;utm_content=Email1&amp;utm_industry=retail&amp;utm_sub-industry=Convenience_&amp;_Fuel#rpos]]&gt;

NCR Foodservice. Why? Foodservice sales grew at double the rate of c-store revenues last year. But you can help create an experience that rivals quick-service restaurants—while streamlining your operation. Take a look at this brochure &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/retail/convenience-fuel-retail/shell?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=Other&amp;utm_campaign=2021_March_MajorOilShellCampaign_Retail&amp;utm_content=Email1&amp;utm_industry=retail&amp;utm_sub-industry=Convenience_&amp;_Fuel#foodservice_brochure]]&gt;. 

NCR Self-Checkout. Again, COVID is driving serious shopper changes: a full 75% plan to use convenience store self-checkouts now. But only NCR offers one key feature that all c-stores need. See it here &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/retail/convenience-fuel-retail/shell?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=Other&amp;utm_campaign=2021_March_MajorOilShellCampaign_Retail&amp;utm_content=Email1&amp;utm_industry=retail&amp;utm_sub-industry=Convenience_&amp;_Fuel#self_checkout]]&gt;.
