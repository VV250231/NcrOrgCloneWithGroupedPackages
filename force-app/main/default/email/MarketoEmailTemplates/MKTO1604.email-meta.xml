    <textOnly>It was great talking with you at the National Restaurant Association show. Thank you for stopping by our booth. We loved getting the chance to show you our latest technology and how we can help run your restaurant end-to-end.

Our favorite part of the show was getting to connect with everyone in person again. We’re feeling energized, and we hope you are too. 

We’ll be in touch soon, but feel free to go ahead and set up time to chat &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/restaurants/contact-us]]&gt; more.
