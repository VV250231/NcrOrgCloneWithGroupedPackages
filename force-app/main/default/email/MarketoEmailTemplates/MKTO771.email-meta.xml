    <subject>1LINK &amp; NCR Webinar: How Can FIs Reduce ATM Channel Costs and Complexities through ATMaaS?</subject>
    <textOnly>Managing your ATM channel is time consuming, costly and complex.
 
But what if it was possible to be free from the daily burden of regulatory compliance, security, cash management, vendor management and maintenance…while effortlessly innovating the consumer 
experience?

With ATM as a Service, it is possible.
 
1LINK and NCR will jointly talk about how, whether you’re a global FI or a regional member-owned institution, ATMaaS can help you refocus your limited resources on more valuable areas of your business.

Join us on Tuesday, July 13th at 3pm PKT where 1LINK and NCR expert presenters will discuss the challenges faced today by institutions with the growing complexity of an ATM network.
