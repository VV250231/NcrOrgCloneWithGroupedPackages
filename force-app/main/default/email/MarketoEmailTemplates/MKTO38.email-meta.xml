    <textOnly>Unlock {{company.Company Name:default=your store}}&apos;s true potential
with a software-defined approach
&lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/retail/software-defined-store/unlock-potential]]&gt;
{{lead.First Name:default=Dear Mr/Ms}}, what could it mean for {{company.Company Name:default=your store}} to run “thin”? This means taking the software off your store devices and managing it all from the cloud.

 The numbers in this recently commissioned Total Economic Impact™ study by Forrester Consulting &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/retail/software-defined-store/unlock-potential]]&gt; offer a compelling case:




	-   57% annual hardware cost savings per store
	-   50% reduction in unplanned downtime, mitigating revenue loss
	-   50% reduction in break-fix and software upgrade costs
	-   Improved store efficiency by 10%
	-   6-month payback




One retail customer said:

“With Software Defined Store, opening a new store is much quicker than before. There is probably 50% savings in time and effort. We expect things like faster acquisition.”
