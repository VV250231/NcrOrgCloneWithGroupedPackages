Reopening Your Restaurant: What You Need to Know
As some markets are loosening restrictions for restaurants to reopen, we’ve created a series on NCR.com titled, “Reopening Your Restaurant: What You Need to Know” &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/blogs/restaurants/reopening-your-restaurant-what-you-need-to-know]]&gt; 
to help operators navigate this new way of operating during the pandemic. We’ve compiled some practical, helpful guidance, and considerations on various topics ranging from evaluating finances to renegotiating leases to deep cleaning best practices and much more.

Reminder: Fulfillment Orders on Independence Day – July 3, 2020
Friday, July 3, 2020 is Independence Day, a U.S. national holiday observed by NCR and our logistics provider. It is not considered a business day, so all orders will be fulfilled as listed below. The cut off time for all orders is 6:00 p.m. ET. 

  • Next Calendar Day (NCD) service level orders are not affected by the holiday. These orders will be shipped the same day as ordered and delivered the following day.
  • Next Business Day (NBD) service level orders will be fulfilled on the next business day following the holiday.
  • Next Flight Out (NFO) service level orders will be available every day, including Friday, July 3rd and Saturday, July 4th.
