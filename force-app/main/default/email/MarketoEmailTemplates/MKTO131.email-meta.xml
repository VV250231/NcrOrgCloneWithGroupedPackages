    <subject>Get Contactless Order &amp; Pay Features for Aloha</subject>
    <textOnly>We’re all learning how to adapt and be agile in 2020. You’re trying to make up lost revenue with curbside pickup and takeout and get new guests in the door.
 
Now you can make {{company.Company Name:default=your restaurant}}’s contactless curbside pickup and dine-in experiences easier, and give your guests the confidence to return, with Aloha’s new contactless order and pay for dine-in.

At the restaurant, your guests simply use their 
mobile phone to scan a QR code and:

          1. See your digital menu
          2. Order what they want
          3. Pay for their order

It looks like you’re using an outdated version of Aloha. There are hundreds of new features – like this one! – that you’re missing out on.

Do you have time on your calendar to discuss? One of our NCR Aloha restaurant consultants will be following up 
with you in the next week or you can sign up for our waitlist.
