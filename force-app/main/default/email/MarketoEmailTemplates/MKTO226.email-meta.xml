 How to Use MyNCR Online Invoice Payments

Just log in &lt;[[http://myncr.ncr.com/]]&gt; to MyNCR like you usually do and visit the “Invoices” page.

Then you can choose one of two paths to pay your invoices:



	- Pay a single invoice by visiting the Invoice Detail page and clicking the “Pay Now” button.
	- Pay multiple invoices at once by selecting their checkboxes in the “Invoice Table” view and clicking the “Pay Now” button.


You can also get a step-by-step walkthrough in the attached training guide &lt;[[https://go.ncr.com/rs/605-BQY-740/images/How to Pay Invoices in MyNCR.pdf]]&gt;. To find it on the site, click the question mark button on MyNCR to visit the Help Center.
