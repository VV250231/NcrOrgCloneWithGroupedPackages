    <subject>A Way to Help You Keep Up with All the Changes</subject>
    <textOnly>Even with all of the changes you’ve recently made to your restaurant, it may seem like it’s still not enough. But, we care about your business and we’re here to help. 

While your current Aloha POS has been helping you run your restaurant, features of the updated Aloha Essentials solution go further, seamlessly enabling contactless payments, supporting online orders and simplifying curbside pickup. 

Reach out to one of our representatives today or simply reply to this email to learn more about getting current with your Aloha solution. In fact, you may be able to get up to six months free.
