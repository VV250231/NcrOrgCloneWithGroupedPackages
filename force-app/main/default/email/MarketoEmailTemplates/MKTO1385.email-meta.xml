    <subject>NGA 2021: Join NCR to see where grocery retail is headed</subject>
    <textOnly>The pandemic has substantially changed the way consumers shop. Online grocery sales have surged to an all-time high and will be here to stay. As customers steer to a touch free experience, self-checkout use has spiked, and flexible checkout options are a must in meeting customers’ demand.
 
Join NCR at NGA 2021 in Booth #525. We’ll be showcasing two of our latest technology advancements: NCR Freshop, our 
eCommerce solution specifically for grocers that is ramped up in weeks, as well as our market leading Self-Checkout Solutions.
 
We’re looking forward to seeing you there!
