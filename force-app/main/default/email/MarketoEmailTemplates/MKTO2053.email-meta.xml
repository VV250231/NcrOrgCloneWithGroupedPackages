    <subject>NCR Aloha Cloud 6.3 Pilot is Here</subject>
    <textOnly>A new version of Aloha Cloud is now available as a pilot. 
With version 6.3, you have:




	- POS Notifications for Online Orders: You can see what orders you have coming up that business day on the top right of your screen. Future orders will display as new orders on the date the order needs to be made.  




	- Auto-Closed Optional Modifiers: Your optional modifier groups will be closed when you first see the screen, and your required mods will stay open, so you can take orders more quickly. You can also go to the Back Office and bring all your required mods to the top. 



If you would like to request access to this pilot release, please contact Customer Support at 877-270-3475. 
  
 If you&apos;re approved to receive the update, 
your system will update to the pilot automatically once it&apos;s available if you have automatic updates enabled. 
  
 If you don&apos;t have automatic updates enabled, you can update to 6.3 by tapping the “Upgrade” button from the cloud icon on the POS. 
  


Note: We are no longer supporting Mac Mini servers on macOS v10.9 or older*. If you use a Mac Mini server with your Aloha Cloud solution, you will need to be on a higher version of macOS before you update to Aloha Cloud v6.3.

If your macOS version is out of date, it will affect your ability to manage tickets and send them to the kitchen. To get the best experience with Aloha Cloud:


	- Update the OS software, if supported
	- Purchase a newer Mac Mini that can support the latest macOS versions



*Mac Mini macOS versions that are currently supported are: Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura.
