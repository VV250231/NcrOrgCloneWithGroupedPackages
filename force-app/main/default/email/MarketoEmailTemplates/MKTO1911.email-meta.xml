    <subject>Attention: Important Changes to your POS</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,
As we evolve our restaurant solutions, we want to ensure we are providing the most secure updates for your business and your customers. 
 January 30, 2023, we are changing the minimum version available of our POS software from 5.8 to 6.2. If you are currently on version 5.8, 6.0, 6.1 or 6.1.1, you will need to upgrade your POS software.  
All customers are required to take this upgrade. If no upgrade is run on your POS, you will be locked out of your system starting on January 30, 2023. 
Now is the time to run the upgrade and train your staff to protect against any disruptions to your operations. To help ease this transition, we encourage you to check out our resource hub &lt;[[https://docs.ncr.com/restaurant/aloha-cloud/about/overview/]]&gt; to learn more about the latest features and functionalities of Aloha Cloud, formerly Silver Pro Restaurant.
If you are on 5.8, you will be automatically upgraded from Silver Pro Restaurant to Aloha Cloud. Rest assured that although the software has a different name and look, your data, billing and NCR  contacts will stay the same.
If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to support at 877-270-3475.</textOnly>
