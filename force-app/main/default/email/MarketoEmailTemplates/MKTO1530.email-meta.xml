CUSTOMER SPOTLIGHT VIDEO
Many thanks to John D’Anna and the rest of his team at Northgate for letting us come on site to capture all of this great footage to help tell the story of Northgate Markets &amp; NCR.

We’re planning on highlighting other Emerald users for our Customer Spotlight videos since many of you are soon to Go-Live or start your rollouts. Keep an eye out for an email from Jeanne Bosworth to set something up at one of your Emerald locations!
NCR TEAM MEMBER HIGHLIGHTS
At the recommendation of our Advisory Board, we will recognize team members from both NCR and client who have done outstanding work on the Emerald solution, pilots and rollouts.

Stefan Nikodijevic is a Software Support Specialist for Emerald who is a rising star: fresh from graduating University of Belgrade, he went straight to the L2 support group. Stefan has the ability to learn quickly and possess technical skills that have not gone unnoticed: he has recently been promoted to the L3 team where he can bring his qualities to the maximum. His dedication and motivation are much appreciated!

She transitioned to the Emerald team in 2018 working as a Business Analyst for the Meijer Market Format Team. She is currently working as a BA on the BevMo! and Brookshire’s accounts and has proven her ability to earn trust with customers and lay the groundwork for a successful project. Amy is a lifelong Minnesota girl who enjoys family time, lake time, concerts, hockey, road trips and most any DIY project.
RETAILER UPDATES

Big Y Foods, Inc. went live with their Emerald Fuel Pilot on 3/24/22 at their Wilbraham, MA location. Mike Tami, Big Y’s CIO &amp; member of our Emerald Community Advisory Board, filled up his tank at 5:00pm that day. We converted the remaining register and fuel pumps &amp; now the entire store is running on Emerald. What a tremendous accomplishment!

Stater Bros has rolled out 52+ stores with plans to rollout 12 stores a week until all 172 stores are up &amp; running Emerald; targeting a June 2022 completion. Stater Bros has owned majority of the Emerald transition on their own without much assistance from NCR – great job to both teams!

“The upgrade imperative has hit retail,” said David Wilkinson, president and general manager, NCR Retail. “Retailers globally are seeing consumer demand and they are looking to differentiate the in-store experience with software. And with our NCR POS Software that connects to the NCR Commerce Platform retailers and restaurants can do just that. It enables them to introduce new capabilities like advanced loyalty, online ordering or inventory management quickly.”

Thanks to each of you for contributing to NCR owning the market in our industry!
THANK YOU!
