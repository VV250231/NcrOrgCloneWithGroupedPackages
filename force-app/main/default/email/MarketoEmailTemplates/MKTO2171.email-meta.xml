    <textOnly>A new Back Office update is now live. Your POS will not be affected and you can continue to ring up sales as usual during this window. 


With this version 23.3 release, you can:



	- View the &quot;Hide on POS&quot; status on customer tender.

	- Manage discounts on the POS across stores. You can perform the required changes without navigating to each individual store.
	- View or hide data for multi-store restaurants. You can now view or hide data by store in the Item Sales, Modifier Sales and Sales Summary reports.
	- Upload an image for items. In the Extended Item Setup, you can preview the image and, if required, replace or delete a previously uploaded image.
