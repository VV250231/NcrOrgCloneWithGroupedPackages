Retailers across Europe have never had to work harder to attract and inspire customers in-store.

Self-service options help by making checkout easy and efficient—driving customer loyalty, reducing operational costs and unlocking greater productivity. 

But what does this retail revolution mean for your store design, queue management, colleagues and customers? How can new technologies help minimize stock loss and improve margins? 

Join NCR for our expert self-checkout panel to find out.

In the session, our panel, hosted by business journalist and retail commentator James Ashton, will discuss these challenges, 
including the technology underpinning this change.

After the panel discussion, 
you’ll be able to download our guide to boosting customer experience and minimizing stock loss through self-checkouts.
