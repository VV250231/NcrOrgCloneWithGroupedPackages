    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
At NCR, we are committed to helping you run your business better, so you have more time to take care of your customers for lasting success.
 
As I shared in my previous note, the feedback you provide in our surveys is critical to influencing our product, service and overall customer experience improvements. Your responses help us understand how we are performing and where we can continue to improve.

If you haven’t already, please consider taking a few minutes to complete the NCR Customer Satisfaction Survey 2022 (sent from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt;) so we can learn your valuable 
insights.

As always, thank you for being an NCR customer. I appreciate your participation in advance.
 
Best regards,

Dirk Izzo
President &amp; General Manager
NCR Hospitality
