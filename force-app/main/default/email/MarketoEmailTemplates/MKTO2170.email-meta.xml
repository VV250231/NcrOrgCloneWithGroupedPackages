    <textOnly>Important Update: Freight Rate Adjustments for ATM 
Shipments
To our valued Channel Partners,
 
NCR is committed to being a reliable provider of high-quality products 
and services to help our shared customers run their businesses. Due to market and supply-chain dynamics, we conduct regular reviews of the costs involved in doing so and make requisite adjustments as appropriate.

As part of regular review of freight costs in the United States, NCR will be adjusting the default freight charges for all ATM classes, effective May 1, 2023 (detailed below). This follows a detailed, multi-faceted freight cost analysis of our ATM portfolio, resulting in freight charge increases and decreases dependent on ATM class. These changes will be reflected in NCR quoting systems on May 1, 2023.

environment continues to change. Thank you for your continued partnership and collaboration through this process, and please reach out to your CAM with any questions.

NCR Global Channel Program Team
