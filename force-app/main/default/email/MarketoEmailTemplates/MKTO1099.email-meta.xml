I’m looking to talk with customers like you and find ways to share and amplify your success story – from early days to how NCR helps you run your restaurant today so you can focus on delivering amazing experiences. My team and I are reaching out to select customers who might have a stellar story about working with NCR - and we want to write about it. 

We’d love to hear your story and work closely together to ensure your brand is well positioned while helping promote our partnership.

If you’re interested, just reply to this email, and we can talk about the best way to highlight your story.

If you have any questions about the process, I’m here to answer them. Hope to work together soon in telling your business story. Look forward to hearing from you.

Warm Regards,
