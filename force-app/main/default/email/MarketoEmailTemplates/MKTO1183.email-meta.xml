    <subject>End of Life for WatchGuard XTM-25W Firewall</subject>
    <textOnly>On July 1, 2021, the WatchGuard XTM-25W firewall went into end of life and WatchGuard is no longer providing firmware or patch updates on these devices. All sites with the XTM-25W received new hardware earlier this year to replace the devices.

This is a reminder to make sure that you have swapped out the XTM-25W by December 31, 2021. These devices are “plug and play”, meaning you will only need to swap cables from the XTM-25W to the 
respective port(s) of the new firewall. Along with the new hardware, we provided a detailed step-by-step document on how to perform this swap.
 
Our support team is available if you need any assistance in performing this task. If this swap is not performed by December 31, 2021, you will not be able to process credit cards on January 1, 2022.

If you have any questions, please contact support@alohaenterprise.com &lt;[[mailto:support@alohaenterprise.com]]&gt; or log a 
support ticket through the Pulse Real-Time app.</textOnly>
