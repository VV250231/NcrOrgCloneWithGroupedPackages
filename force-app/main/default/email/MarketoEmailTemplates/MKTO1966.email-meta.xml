    <subject>Is your Huntington Technology Lease Expiring? What to do next</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Owner Operator:

 You are receiving this email because you may have a lease expiring 
soon with hardware purchased through the NCR Program with Huntington Financial. If you do, Huntington will be sending communications 60 days from the lease expiration date with your 4 options. In the meantime, NCR wants to ensure you have time to review your 4 options in advance. Please see below.



	- 
Sign a new lease with HTF and NCR.

	- 
Extend the existing lease for 6 months after which the lease will terminate, and the ownership of all leased equipment will transfer to the owner/operator. 

	- 
Purchase the leased equipment at the end of the leased term for 10% of the original financed amount.

	- 
Direct buy or finance (with payment plan) new equipment.




For more information regarding what is on your lease, please contact Huntington directly to send you the information @ mcdonalds.support@huntington.Atlassian.net. If you are looking to receive new leased hardware, please contact NCR @ Mcdonalds.orders@ncr.com or call 1-800-421-8230.
 
Thank you,
The NCR McDonalds Team
