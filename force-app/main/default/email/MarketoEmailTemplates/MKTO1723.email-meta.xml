    <subject>Notice for all LocatorSearch clients</subject>
    <textOnly>In 
order to improve the security and stability of the platform, LocatorSearch will deploy an update to its cipher suite security. This update will disable connections to LocatorSearch through TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 connections and connections through HTTP.

When will this update take place?
The update will occur on 9/21/2022.

Will this update affect me?
The update is only expected to impact a very small number of clients who are using outdated TLS 1.0/1.1 
cipher suites or insecure HTTP connections. Clients using modern TLS 1.2 and HTTPS connections will not be affected. 

Please check with your IT team to verify that your website or application is connecting to LocatorSearch securely and reach out to support@locatorsearch.com &lt;[[mailto:support@locatorsearch.com]]&gt; if you have any questions.

Regards,
The LocatorSearch Team
