Interactive Teller Machines (ITMs) provide remote teller assistance via video – enabling you to migrate more transactions away from in-branch tellers and extend {{company.Company Name:default=your financial institution}}&apos;s hours to further improve the customer experience by helping customers bank on their schedule. 

NCR has deployed more than 10,000 ITMs across 20 countries with more than 700 customers. And our financial institution customers are reporting significant results, including: 



	- 60% increase in branch sales
	- 88% increase in consumer hours
	- 50% reduction in branch operating costs
	- 66% reduction in labor costs
	- 65% reduction in drive through transaction times
	- 6x more deposit loan accounts opened
	- 30% of teller transactions occurring outside standard branch hours


It’s a proven technology that allows you to cost-effectively deliver a face-to-face experience to your customers, while differentiating your brand and achieving the benefits transformation can deliver.
