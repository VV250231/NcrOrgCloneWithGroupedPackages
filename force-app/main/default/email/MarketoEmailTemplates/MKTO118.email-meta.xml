Fulfillment Orders Reminder for Independence Day – July 3, 2020
Friday, July 3, 2020 is Independence Day, a U.S. national holiday observed by NCR and our logistics provider. It is not considered a business day, so all orders will be fulfilled as listed below. The cut off time for all orders is 6:00 p.m. ET. 
 

 	- Next Calendar Day (NCD) service level orders are not affected by the holiday. These orders will be shipped the same day as ordered and delivered the following day. 	- Next Business Day (NBD) service level orders will be fulfilled on the next business day following the holiday. 	- Next Flight Out (NFO) service level orders will be available every day, including Friday, July 3rd and Saturday, July 4th.
NCR Payment Solutions Lab Setup
To order Equinox Luxe lab equipment, allow a 3 - 4 week lead time to receive the equipment. Please use the Aloha with NCR Payment Solutions Playbook &lt;[[https://ncr.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC8MoPZjahn0uillmSQzdLcg]]&gt; for information on processes to set up your equipment.

Your Channel Account Managers are available to assist if you have any questions. Cloud Sales Representatives are also available to help you input NCR Payment Solutions orders into Salesforce. Leveraging them as a resource will prevent issues in implementation due to hardware delays.
