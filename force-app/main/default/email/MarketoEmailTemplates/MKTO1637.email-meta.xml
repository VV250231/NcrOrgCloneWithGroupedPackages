    <subject>UPDATE: NCR RaaS Hospitality Billing and Invoices</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear RaaS Community,
 
NCR is pleased to support your restaurants under our RaaS solution.
 
We are contacting you to provide an update on NCR RaaS Hospitality billing and invoices.
 
NCR has now transitioned your portfolio from DUMAC Business Systems, Inc. to NCR RaaS. With this, please remit all payments (including payment for any invoices sent by DUMAC on behalf of NCR), made payable to NCR, to the address below. Alternatively, you may log in to your MyNCR account and submit payment via ACH. 
 
In addition to the new payment instructions, we are currently working through final integration activities which include establishing the monthly services billing and associating payments with invoices that were carried over from the DUMAC system. We strive to finalize all integration associated tasks as quickly as possible. 
 
If you have an issue with an invoice or payment, please contact WendysRaaSClientServices@ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:WendysRaaSClientServices@ncr.com]]&gt;.   

Payment Submission Details:
Our Employer identification # is 31-0387920. For organizations that require a W9 from NCR to make payment, please click here &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/content/dam/web/documents/hospitality/2022-form-w9-ncr-corporation-signed.pdf]]&gt;.
