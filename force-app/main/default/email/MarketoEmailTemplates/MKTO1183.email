<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #1d1d1d;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On July 1, 2021, the WatchGuard XTM-25W firewall went into end of life and WatchGuard is no longer providing firmware or patch updates on these devices. All sites with the XTM-25W received new hardware earlier this year to replace the devices.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>This is a reminder to make sure that you have swapped out the XTM-25W by December 31, 2021.</strong> These devices are “plug and play”, meaning you will only need to swap cables from the XTM-25W to the respective port(s) of the new firewall. Along with the new hardware, we provided a detailed step-by-step document on how to perform this swap.</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Our support team is available if you need any assistance in performing this task. <strong>If this swap is not performed by December 31, 2021, you will not be able to process credit cards on January 1, 2022.</strong></span><br /><br /></span><span style="color: #1d1d1d;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:support@alohaenterprise.com" target="_blank" id="">support@alohaenterprise.com</a> or log a support ticket through the Pulse Real-Time app.</span></span></span>
