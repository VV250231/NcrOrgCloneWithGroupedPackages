    <subject>Are you ready to modernize your teller system?</subject>
    <textOnly>Most financial institutions are running legacy teller systems that still use technology developed 10, 20, even 50 years ago. They are expensive, inflexible, difficult for your bankers to learn and use and not aligned to modern architecture — which means you can’t innovate. 

Modern branches are more open, with staff no longer tethered to the counter and bankers working closer to their customers. Modernizing the teller system is a key enabler for that shift.

Read our latest blog to find out how financial institutions are changing this paradigm.
