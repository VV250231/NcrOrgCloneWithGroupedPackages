    <subject>Article: How Can I Drive Personalization at Scale?</subject>
    <textOnly>According to a recent NCR study, 60% of consumers are interested in receiving personalized financial advice from their financial institution.*

But if MORE THAN HALF &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/blogs/banking/delivering-personalized-experiences-in-a-digital-first-world]]&gt; of consumers want their FI to offer that—how in the world do you start?

With data.

Because FIs like yours have a TON of data that you’re already collecting from your customers, transactions and touchpoints.

Now all you need is a digital-first personalization strategy.

See how everyone from Netflix to Spotify to Sleep Number to fashion retailer ASOS are achieving personalization at scale—and how banks can, too.
*This survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of NCR from February 4-8, 2021, among 2,007 U.S. banking consumers (defined as those who have a primary financial institution) ages 18 and older. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore, no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. For complete survey methodology, including weighting variables and subgroup sample sizes, please contact Eric Brandt &lt;mailto:Eric.Brantd@ncr.com&gt;.
