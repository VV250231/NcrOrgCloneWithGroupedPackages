    <textOnly>Dear valued customer,

We are writing to let you know that we are switching our toll-free telephone provider. This is expected to occur in mid-July. While we are taking every measure to have a smooth transition, as with any technology conversion there is a possibility that an outage may occur during this change. If at any time you are unable to connect with the NCR support team via the toll-free number, please use the alternative number provided below to connect with us for your support needs.

We will notify you once the switch is complete.
 
Regards,

Your NCR Support Team
