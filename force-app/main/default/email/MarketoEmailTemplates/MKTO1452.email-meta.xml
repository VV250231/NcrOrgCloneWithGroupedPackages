    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
Continuously improving our customers’ experience remains one of NCR’s top priorities. That is why we take your feedback seriously and are asking you to complete the NCR Customer Satisfaction Survey 2022. You will receive a survey link from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt; in the next few days.

 In the meantime, I am pleased to share that the actions we had taken on previous survey results created positive progress in our overall customer experience, for example:


	- We have invested significantly over the last six months in new infrastructure and automation within our billing systems to not only improve accuracy and ease of understanding, but also enable simplification and standardization of invoice formats, and enhanced on-demand access to invoice details and reconciliation actions.




	- Aloha Simplification—we are executing on quarterly releases, which continue to improve deployment, upgrade experience, and customer configuration tools. Additionally, each quarter, we are expanding and improving above-store and in-store APIs for common services that work across both Aloha and Silver.




	- We continue to transform our business into regionally focused teams to ensure we thoroughly understand our customers’ unique businesses and are better poised to assist with issue resolution or in supporting their goals.


I hope you will take our NCR Customer Satisfaction Survey 2022 and share your candid opinion with us. Your feedback is essential for improving our offerings, which can help you run your business better.
 
Thank you for being an NCR customer. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Dirk Izzo
