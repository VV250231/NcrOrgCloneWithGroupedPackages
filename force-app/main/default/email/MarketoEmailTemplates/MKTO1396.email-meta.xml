    <subject>It’s time to start offering the connected experience your customers crave</subject>
    <textOnly>Your customers expect to be able to move their transaction across different channels. And they expect your staff to have visibility and be able to jump in and help if needed. 

But most FIs have siloed technologies that fall short of true continuity across channels. 

There is a solution: NCR Channel Services. An API-driven platform that enables Wells Fargo to modernize its infrastructure and converge its channels to deliver the seamless connected experience your customers demand. 

And that’s not all. This cloud-based technology enables you to add or develop new services and functionality easily and cost effectively, giving you the agility to respond to changing consumer demands quickly. 

Watch our video and see how NCR Channel Services brings together all the components you need to converge channels and deliver seamless experiences.
