    <textOnly>We’re excited to invite you to join NCR’s expert panel discussing challenges faced today with Cash Management, Thursday June 17th 2-2.30pm EST. 

The costs of cash holding and delivery are the highest expenses in ATM operation, but implementing a cash management solution to reduce this expense can sometimes feel too complex or risky. 


	- 
Why is cash management important? 

	- What is the difference between cash management and cash optimisation? 
	- Is this still needed when new technologies like recycling can reduce cash handling? 
	- 
It sounds complex and expensive to do this – is it worth it?



Our expert panel, will address these questions and discuss the technology solutions that can help you improve your cash management and save money.


	- Fiona McDade, Moderator Senior Marketing Manager
	- Robert Johnston, Panelist, Senior Marketing Manager, Cash Management
