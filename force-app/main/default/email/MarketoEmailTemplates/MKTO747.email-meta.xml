You’ll move more cash transactions to the ATM, relieving pressure on tellers. But more importantly, you’ll significantly reduce cash in transit costs…by as much as 50%.
That’s why NCR has just launched our latest cash recycling ATM, the NCR SelfServ 61 – designed specifically for the Indian market.
