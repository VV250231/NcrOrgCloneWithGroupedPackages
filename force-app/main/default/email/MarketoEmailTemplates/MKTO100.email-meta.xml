    <subject>Our NCR community is here to support you</subject>
    <textOnly>To our customers,

We are experiencing an unprecedented time in both our personal and professional lives.  Within the last week, protests in the United States in response to recent events and injustice are creating a dialogue about the way we need to treat our neighbors that is spreading around the world.  While tragic events were the catalyst for this, it is my hope that as a nation, and a global community, that we will emerge stronger.

Our CEO, Mike Hayford, sent a note to our NCR community &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/company/responding-to-injustice-as-one-global-community]]&gt; yesterday that I wanted to share. I want you as our customers to know that our company is global, diverse and inclusive, but simply having a diverse employee base is not enough. We want to be an active part of the solution, and this starts with our leadership team and requires action. We are fostering an open dialogue amongst ourselves and in our communities.

I hope you’ll take a moment to read Mike’s letter and know that we are proud to call you our customer. We are here to support and help you as one NCR team as we continue to keep retail around the globe running.
