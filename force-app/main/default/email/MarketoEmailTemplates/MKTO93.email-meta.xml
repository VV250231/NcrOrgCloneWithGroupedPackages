    <subject>Add contactless payments to Aloha for {{company.Company Name:default=your restaurant&apos;s}} guests</subject>
    <textOnly>Mobile Payment For Restaurants
When it’s time to reopen {{company.Company Name:default=your restaurant}}, contactless transactions can put guests at ease, keep everyone safer—and give your guests another reason to return.
You can now easily add contactless payments to your existing Aloha technology, no additional hardware needed. It’s simple – guests just scan, pay and go.
