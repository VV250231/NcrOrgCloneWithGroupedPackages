    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
Continuously improving our customers’ experience remains one of NCR’s top priorities. That is why we take your feedback seriously and are asking you to take the NCR Customer Satisfaction Survey 2022. You will receive the survey link from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com in the next few days. 

I hope you will take our survey and share your honest opinion with us. Your feedback is essential for improving our offerings, which can help you run your business better. 

Thank you for being an NCR customer. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Don Layden
