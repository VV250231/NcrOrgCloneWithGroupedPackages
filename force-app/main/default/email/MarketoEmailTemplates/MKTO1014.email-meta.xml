Beginning Monday, October 11, you’ll start receiving our 2021 relationship survey. It takes only about three minutes to complete and focuses on several ways to strengthen our strategic relationship. The survey is flexible, so you can skip areas that don’t apply. And we love written feedback. This is a big help in understanding the results. 

Your voice truly matters and we’re eager to hear from you. Thank you for your feedback and support. It’s a privilege to be your strategic partner.

Sincerely,

Sophia Williams
