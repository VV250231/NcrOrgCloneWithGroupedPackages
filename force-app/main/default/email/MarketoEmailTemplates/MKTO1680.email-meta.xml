    <textOnly>Dear 
{{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

Earlier this year, we conducted our 2022 NCR Customer 
Satisfaction Survey, with many of our customers participating and sharing their opinion with us. We continue to use that feedback as a foundation for how we learn, improve and make working with us simpler—all to keep our customers satisfied and grow together. 

After several weeks of analyzing the survey, I am excited to let you know we saw improvement in the overall survey results for the fourth consecutive year, particularly in our Net Promoter Score (NPS).

At the same time, we know there is always opportunity for improvement. Based on your feedback, we are focusing on the following areas within the NCR Banking business unit:


	- 
Advance and simplify our purchasing and renewal procedures

	- 
Streamline our onboarding capabilities and improve our solution performance 

	- 
Maintain continuous process development and practices for maintenance and support 

	- 
Partner with you to deliver positive business outcomes and the best experience possible



As always, thank you for being an NCR customer. We look forward to making further improvements and continuing to hear from you.

Warmest regards,

Frank M. Hauck
President and General Manager
NCR Banking
