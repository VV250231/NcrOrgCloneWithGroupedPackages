    <subject>Learn how to get funding for COVID-19 Losses</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued NCR Customer}},


Restaurants everywhere, regardless of their size, have experienced financial challenges due to COVID-19. The American Rescue Plan Act established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) to provide funding of up to $10M per business to help restaurants and other eligible businesses keep their doors open.

Join NCR and the SBA for a free virtual webinar on April 29, 2021, to learn more about the RRF grants, eligibility requirements, and how NCR is assisting our customers with accessing some of the data you’ll need to apply. You’ll also have a chance to personally ask the panelists everything you want to know about the RRF program.

Featured Panelists: 

Murali Patnam, Vice President &amp; GM, NCR Hospitality - Small &amp; Medium Business

Nicola Montagna, Small Business Administration, Special Assistant Office of Capital Access

Anna Lucas, Small Business Administration, Senior Advisor for the Office of Field Operations
