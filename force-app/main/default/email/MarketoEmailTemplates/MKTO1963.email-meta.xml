    <subject>Important Update: Price Increases for NCR POS Products</subject>
    <textOnly>To our Channel Partners,

2022 has been a challenging year globally with a multitude of macroeconomic headwinds and the focus at NCR has remained unchanged: to continue to deliver high quality products to our customers. These challenges have necessitated an increase in traditional hardware prices across the Channel partner network. 

Specifically, there are a subset of CX hardware products that will be adjusted. This increase will be effective December 15th, 2022, pricing will be updated in your quoting systems. 

We plan to regularly review our costs as the economic climate changes going into 2023 and will re-evaluate pricing as needed. Thank you for your continued partnership and collaboration through this process, and please reach out to your CAM with any questions. 

We look forward to our continued strong relationship with you.

Best regards, 
NCR Channel
