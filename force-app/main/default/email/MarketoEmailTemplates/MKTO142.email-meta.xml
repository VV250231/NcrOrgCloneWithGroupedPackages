Smooth NCR Mobile Pay Implementations
During the implementation process for NCR Mobile Pay, there are important steps that require POS configuration. We’ve created the NCR Mobile Pay Implementation Guide &lt;[[https://ncr.quickbase.com/up/bqe6gx23b/g/r2/ek/va/NCR%20Mobile%20Pay%20Training%20Update%20for%207-23-20.pdf]]&gt; to help support your team in getting up to speed and ensure the installs go smoothly and quickly. Review this information with your team, along with the other Mobile Pay supporting documents, videos, and training materials provided.
 
Additionally, make sure your team is leveraging these excellent NCR Mobile Pay customer-facing materials &lt;[[https://ncr.quickbase.com/up/bqe6gx23b/g/r2/ek/va/NCR%20Mobile%20Pay%20Training%20Update%20for%207-23-20.pdf]]&gt; – marketing tool kit, FAQs, videos and more – that explain the benefits of our contactless solution.
