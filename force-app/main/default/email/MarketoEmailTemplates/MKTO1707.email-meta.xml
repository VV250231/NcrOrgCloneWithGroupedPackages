    <textOnly>Important Update: Pricing Update for Channel Software
Dear Channel Partners: 
 
As various contributing factors continue to impact the global economy, we remain committed to delivering best in class solutions and services to run banks, stores, and restaurants around the world. Though we take measures to do so in a cost-effective manner, maintaining the quality and efficiency that our shared customers expect necessitates periodic price increases. As such, beginning September 16, 2022, there will be a 15% increase on perpetual licenses for Hospitality software products. This increase will be reflected during the quoting process. 
 
Thank you for your continued understanding and partnership as we face these challenges together. If you have any questions, please reach out to your Channel Account Manager. 
 
Best regards, 
 
The NCR Global Channel Program Team
