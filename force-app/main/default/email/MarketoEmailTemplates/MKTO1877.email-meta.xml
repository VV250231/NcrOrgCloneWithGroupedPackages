    <textOnly>Dear 
{{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
At NCR, we are committed to helping you run your business better, so you have more time to take care of your customers for lasting success.
 
As I shared in my previous note, we strive to make improvements on the topics that were identified in prior surveys. The feedback we receive through this survey will help us understand how we are performing, and how else we can continue to improve your customer experience.

If you haven’t already, please consider taking a few minutes to complete the NCR Customer Satisfaction Survey 2022 (sent from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt;) so we can learn your valuable insights.

As always, thank you for being an NCR customer. I appreciate your participation in advance.
 
Best regards,

Frank M. Hauck
President &amp; General Manager
NCR Banking
