    <subject>Update from Customer Survey Results</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
At NCR, we remain committed to making 
simple possible for our customers.
 
We’ve sent you an invite to take our annual customer feedback survey from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt;, which will only take a few minutes of your time. 
 
As I shared in my recent note to you, we’re striving to make improvements on the topics you highlighted during last year’s survey, including customer service, onboarding process and availability and quality of software and hardware solutions, and we want to know how we’re doing. Your input will help us learn how we’re performing in those areas and how else we can continue to improve.
 
If you haven’t already, please consider taking the survey so we can learn from your valuable insights. I appreciate your feedback, and, as always, thank you for being an NCR customer.
 
Warmest regards,


Frank Hauck
President, NCR Banking
