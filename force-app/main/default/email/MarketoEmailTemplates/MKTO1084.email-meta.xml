    <textOnly>NCR is helping you make handling coin simple. With two new automated coin handling sidecar modules, you can let customers deposit or withdraw coin through the ATM.
 
Adding automation to the banking self-service mix will save considerable time at the teller counter and deliver a better customer experience for all customers—not just for those trying to deposit coin, but also customers waiting for transactions that take twice 
as long as most others.
