    <subject>Important: Updated List of Contacts may change your migration</subject>
    <textOnly>On September 15th and 21st, you were emailed about a potential digital online ordering migration. This was an error on our behalf. There has been an update on the names listed, and we will move forward with the updated list of restaurants. (Note: if you have multiple restaurants, some may be on the migrate list, while others are not). Thanks for being patient while we sort this out. Our relationship is extremely important to us, and we never want our errors to set you off track.
 
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
