    <subject>Hot Insights! 2022 Ecommerce Trends That You Need to Know</subject>
    <textOnly>Did you know that online grocery sales are projected 
to increase by 23% each year?

That’s a major revenue stream that you don’t want to miss out on—and if you have an eCommerce solution that’s eating up your margins, there’s a chance you’re missing out on quite a bit of cash.

Other eCommerce solutions chew up your margins quick and give you a limited view into your customer 
data. And unfortunately, you lose control of your customer experience and sacrifice quality delivery, too.

As you re-evaluate your current eCommerce solution, make sure you’re up to date on the latest in grocery eCommerce trends to inform your decision.
