    <subject>Attention: Set your modifier variables to default by Sunday</subject>
    <textOnly>As we continue to making improvements to Aloha Cloud, we want to minimize any disruption to your day-to-day business.

Please 
log into your Aloha Cloud Back Office to make sure any of your linked items with modifier variations are properly set and your default variations are enabled correctly by Sunday, January 29, 2023.


Once the new Back Office update happens on Monday, January 30, modifier variations will become unselected and will require manual configuration again.


How can you tell your modifiers are set up properly?
First, you need to check what items have modifier variations. These will be listed in your Back Office.


Once you see that they have 
modifier variations, check to make sure they’re set to default.



If you have any questions or need further assistance, please call support at 877-270-3475.
