Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
At NCR, we remain committed to making simple possible for our customers.
 
We’ve sent you an invite to take our annual customer 
feedback survey from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt;, which will only take a few minutes of your time. 
 
As I shared in my recent note to you, we’re striving to make improvements on the topics you highlighted during last year’s survey: simplification and communication. We want to know how we’re doing. Your input will help us learn how we’re performing in those areas and how else we can continue to improve.
 
If you haven’t already, please consider taking the survey so we can learn from your valuable insights. I appreciate your feedback, and, as always, thank you for being an NCR customer.

Warmest regards,


Dirk Izzo
President and General Manager, NCR Hospitality

Sandy Preizler
SVP, Hospitality Global Sales
