    <subject>NCR Supports Restaurant Revitalization Fund Grant Program</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued NCR Customer}},


NCR is working with the Small Business Association (SBA) to help our customers access funding from the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund Grant (RRFG) program. These funds are specifically earmarked to help restaurants that experienced financial losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
How to qualify
Eligible entities are businesses with less than 20 locations that are not permanently closed and include businesses where the public or patrons assemble for the primary purpose of being served food or drink. If your business had lower revenue in 2020 vs. 2019, you may be eligible to apply for the RRFG program. Review the requirements for eligibility in the Restaurant Revitalization Fund Program Guide &lt;[[https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/2021.04.17%20-%20Restaurant%20Revitalization%20Funding%20Program%20Guide%20vFinalshare-508.pdf]]&gt;.
NCR helps you get access to sales data
A sample of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund Grant Application is available &lt;[[https://www.sba.gov/document/sba-form-3172-restaurant-revitalization-funding-application-sample]]&gt; and we recommend that you download it to start collecting the documentation required to apply. NCR can provide you with a statement that shows our records of your 2020 vs. 2019 sales data. This can be uploaded with your grant application as supporting documentation when you apply for a grant via the SBA Portal &lt;[[https://restaurants.sba.gov/]]&gt; to help expedite the process. Please note that you should verify any sales data provided by NCR, and that NCR does not guarantee the accuracy of the data provided from our records.
