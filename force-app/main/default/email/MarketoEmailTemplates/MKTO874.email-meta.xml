    <subject>NGA 2021: Join NCR to see where grocery retail is headed</subject>
    <textOnly>Throughout 2020, the retail industry saw curbside pickup increase by more than 500% &lt;[[https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2020/09/30/nearly-44-of-top-500-retailers-with-stores-now-offer-curbside-pickup/]]&gt;.

This is just one example of how NCR is uniquely positioned to provide the solutions that run your stores – from eCommerce, the back office to the front end, and from assisted checkout, self-checkout or mobile checkout.

Join NCR at NGA 2021 in Booth #525. We’ll be showcasing how NCR is leading the way in grocery technology – with our NCR Freshop eCommerce solution as well as latest self-checkout advancements.
