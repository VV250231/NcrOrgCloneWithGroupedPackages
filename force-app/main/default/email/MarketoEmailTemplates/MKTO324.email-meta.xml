    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

We hope you enjoyed the recent 2020 NASM Conference and Industry Summit and that you were able to stop by our booth. If you did, then you know that NCR, from the pump to the store, helps you run your business. 

If you didn’t get a chance to stop by, it’s not too late to read the Shell brochure &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/retail/convenience-fuel-retail/shell]]&gt; we handed out. Either way, please contact us &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/contact-us]]&gt; so that we can share information about NCR offers and RPOS, Self-Checkout and Food Service solutions. 

No risk, no hard sell—just information.

Thanks again and we look forward to talking to you!

Your NCR team</textOnly>
