    <subject>How ITMs deliver a differentiated customer experience</subject>
    <textOnly>The pandemic brought into sharp focus the role ITMs (interactive teller machines) can play in providing face-to-face banking experiences, remotely.

Financial institutions saw their use of ITMs increase 
significantly and many expanded locations and access to ITMs as customers adapted to this new way to bank. 

Tellers in a remote call center can support customers across multiple branches and offsite locations, providing the convenience of extended hours and the ability to bank when, how and where they want.

Explore how Kuwait’s Boubyan Bank is using its ITM network to deliver exceptional customer experiences and differentiate their brand.
