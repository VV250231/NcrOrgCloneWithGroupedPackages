Improve our software support capabilities, incident resolution and response times





	- Simplify your experience, with an emphasis on service excellence and seamless execution




	- Standardize our solutions for better distribution, quality and availability




	- Innovate to create value by extending our digital capabilities and our NCR as a Service offers


We aim to drive substantial progress in these and other areas in 2022. Our Customer Satisfaction Survey program will continue, and we invite you to keep providing your valuable feedback.

Thank you for being an NCR customer and for sharing your experiences with us.

My best,
