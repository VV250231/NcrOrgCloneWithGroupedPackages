    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=valued customer}},

There’s a lot more to customer loyalty than a set-it-and-forget-it cycle: Get a reward for signup. Offer points for purchases. Redeem rewards. Rinse, and repeat. Sound familiar? 

A truly effective strategy is highly personalized, but that doesn’t mean it has to be difficult. A good consumer engagement platform will do the heavy lifting for you through:

Ease-of-use
Access data and reach out to guests easily with a user-friendly, intuitive interface that includes step-by-step prompts.


Marketing ecosystem
Engage with any and all guests and not just the ones who’ve enrolled in your loyalty program.

Data automation
Access data in a few quick clicks and never sweat over manually sorting through spreadsheets again.

Customization
Create individualized experiences that keep 
guests coming back, regardless of your size or concept.


Does your consumer engagement platform deliver these critical elements for a successful engagement strategy?

 Get in touch &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/restaurants/contact-us]]&gt;  to learn how easy data-driven loyalty programs can be.

Sincerely, 

Mike Neri
Vice President of Sales, SMB Hospitality
