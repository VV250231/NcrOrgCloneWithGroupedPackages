    <subject>Is your store Self-Checkout technology safe?</subject>
    <textOnly>With everything going on in a COVID world, the last thing you want to be concerned about is the security and support for your Self-Checkout technology.
 
On October 12, 2021, POS Ready 7 will be end-of-support. This means there will be no OS (operating system) support from Microsoft or NCR, including security-related issues. 

NCR has put together multiple upgrade options ranging from Self-Checkout upgrades to Extended Security Updates (ESU) Program from Microsoft provided by NCR. This enables you to choose an option based on your business priorities. Want to learn more? Reply to this email &lt;[[mailto:Jimmy.Staiti@ncr.com]]&gt;.
