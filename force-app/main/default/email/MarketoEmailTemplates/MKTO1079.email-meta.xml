    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
The last 18 months have been extraordinarily hard, but NCR’s desire to take care of our customers remains paramount. 

As I shared in my recent note to you, we are striving to make improvements on the topics you highlighted during last year’s survey: simplification and communication. We know we still have a way to go, but we want to know how we are doing. Your input will help us learn how we are performing in those areas and how else we can continue to improve

We have sent an invite to take our annual customer feedback survey from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt;, which will only take a few minutes of your time.

If you haven’t already, 
please consider taking the survey so we can learn from your valuable insights. I appreciate your feedback and, as always, thank you for being an NCR customer.

Warmest regards,

Dirk Izzo
President &amp; General Manager, NCR Hospitality

Sandy Preizler
Senior Vice President, NCR Hospitality Sales
