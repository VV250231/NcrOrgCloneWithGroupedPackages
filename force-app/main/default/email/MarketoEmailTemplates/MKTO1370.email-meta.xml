    <subject>You may be overlooking this crucial element in your bank’s digital transformation</subject>
    <textOnly>It’s easy to consider digital transformation from just the consumer perspective. But that’s not all. It’s important to include your staff too. 

People are steadily returning to the branch, but their engagement is different. They’re accustomed to self service for their day-to-day transactions, but they also want support, advice and consultancy. 

Is Wells Fargo ready to free their tellers from their desks and arm them with tablets? Can their branch staff jump in on a transaction a customer has started on their mobile app and help them complete it? Or help them find the best loan or insurance plan? 

This is what customers are now wanting from their branch. Read the blog to find out how.
