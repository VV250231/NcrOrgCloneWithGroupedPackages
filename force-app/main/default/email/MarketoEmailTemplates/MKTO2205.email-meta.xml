    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Channel Partner}},
 
At NCR, enhancing our channel partner experience remains one of our top priorities.

To continuously improve our relationship, we invite you to participate in our NCR Partner Satisfaction Survey 2023. We have put together a list of questions to collect your feedback on critical areas and experiences. The survey will take you less than five minutes to complete. 

We encourage you to participate and share your valuable insights with us. You will receive a personal link to take the survey from partner.success@feedback.ncr.com on Tuesday, April 4. Please add this address to your safe sender list to ensure your email servers do not block it. 

Thank you for being an NCR channel partner. We look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, 

Anastasia Chapek 
Vice President
NCR Sales Strategy and Revenue Operations
