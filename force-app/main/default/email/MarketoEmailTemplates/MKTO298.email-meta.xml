Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

At NCR, we remain committed to making simple possible for our customers.

Recently, you received an invite from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt; to take NCR’s annual customer satisfaction survey. I appreciate you taking a few minutes to share your feedback by completing this survey.

As I shared in my previous message to you, we’ve taken steps to act on your feedback from our 2019 customer satisfaction survey by improving our customer service capabilities, streamlining the invoicing process, and improving the availability and quality of hardware and software.

If you haven’t already, please take this opportunity to let us know how we’re doing in these areas and what matters most to you. Your feedback helps us continue to improve our customer experience and deliver solutions that help your business succeed.

Thank you for being an NCR customer and for offering us your insights.

Warmest regards,

Frank Hauck
