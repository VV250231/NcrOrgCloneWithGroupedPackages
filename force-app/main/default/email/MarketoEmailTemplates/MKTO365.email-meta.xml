    <textOnly>Valued customer, 

On November 12, there was a service interruption that affected NCR Aloha ordering functions and customersâ€™ ability to retrieve store data from the cloud. The outage, which has been resolved, was caused by a hardware failure at a third-party data center and did not impact in-store point of sale solutions or other NCR products or services.

In response, NCR worked with our third-party data center provider to put corrective measures in place to ensure continuity of service.

We apologize for the challenges this may have caused. We will continue to work with your technical teams to make sure everything is back to normal. 

Regards,

Dirk Izzo
