    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

Our connected world is changing the way consumers interact in their day-to-day lives. This includes the way they engage with their bank or credit union, too.

Join our CONNECT webinar series for an in-depth discussion on why the shift to a digital-first banking model is critical and what that means for financial institutions. 

When: Thursday, October 28 at 1 p.m. EDT 

What to expect: We’re bringing together a panel of experts from NCR, Celent, U.S. Bank, National Bank of Egypt and Royal Bank of Canada. Together they’ll cover:



	- How innovation is helping transform engagement






	- New and modern approaches to bridge physical and digital channels






	- First-hand experiences from Financial Institutions that are on this journey
