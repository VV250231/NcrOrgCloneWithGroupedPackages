    <subject>Share Your Feedback On NCR’s Coronavirus Response</subject>
    <textOnly>During the COVID-19 pandemic, NCR’s top priorities are taking care of our employees and taking care of our customers.

We want to make sure that we are meeting your needs. Soon, you’ll be sent a four-question survey asking for your feedback on our coronavirus response. I hope that you will take a minute or two to complete this survey so we can hear from you how we’re doing and incorporate your feedback into our efforts to support you.

I look forward to hearing your feedback. Please know that we are here for you and determined to help your business respond to the challenges you may face.


Best Regards,

Michael D. Hayford
President and Chief Executive Officer
