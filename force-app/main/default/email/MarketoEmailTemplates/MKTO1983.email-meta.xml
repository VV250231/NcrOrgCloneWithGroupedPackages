    <subject>NCR Aloha Cloud 6.3 Pilot is Here</subject>
    <textOnly>A new version of Aloha Cloud is now available as a pilot.
With Version 6.3, your merchants have: 


	- 
POS Notifications for Online Orders:They can see what orders they have coming up that business day on the top right of their screen. Future orders will display as new orders on the date the order needs to be made.  

	- 
Auto-Closed Optional Modifiers: Their optional modifier groups will be closed when they first see the screen, and their required mods will stay open, so they can take orders more quickly. They can also go to the Back Office and bring all their required mods to the top. 



Note: We are no longer supporting Mac Mini servers on macOS v10.9 or older*. If your merchant uses a Mac Mini server with their Aloha Cloud solution, they&apos;ll need to be on a higher version of macOS before they update to Aloha Cloud v6.3.
If your merchants&apos; macOS version is out of date, it will affect their ability to manage tickets and send them to the kitchen.To get the best experience with Aloha Cloud, they&apos;ll need to:




	- Update the OS software, if supported
	- Purchase a newer Mac Mini that can support the latest macOS versions


*Mac Mini macOS versions that are currently supported are: Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura.
