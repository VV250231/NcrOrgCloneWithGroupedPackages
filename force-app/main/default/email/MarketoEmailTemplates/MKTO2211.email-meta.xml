    <textOnly>Dear Owner Operator and OTP:
 
McDonald’s Corporate sent out communication to all sites that need to replace their S200 Media Players. These players have an operating system that is end of life. The S200 Media Players must be replaced by June 30, 2023. NCR’s McDonald’s Account team has been reaching out to you to submit your order. Please make sure you submit your order to be compliant with the McDonald’s System.

Thank you, 
The NCR Team
