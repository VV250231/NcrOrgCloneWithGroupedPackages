    <textOnly>Sustainability is becoming increasingly important for financial institutions looking to reduce their environmental impact. But when providing 24/7 access to cash, reducing energy consumption and associated carbon impact is more challenging.

NCR has focused on helping FIs reduce their environmental impact with its new range of cash recyclers – which use up to 46% LESS power in idle mode.

What’s more, increased cash capacity means they can operate longer between replenishments, 
meaning you’re also reducing cash replenishment trips.
