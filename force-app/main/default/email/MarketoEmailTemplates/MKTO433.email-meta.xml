    <subject>Attending NRF? Join This Q&amp;A on Tackling Your Retail Obstacles</subject>
    <textOnly>Retailers have always had to navigate change.

It’s the only constant. 

And at NRF 2021, NCR will host a virtual fireside Q&amp;A to discuss how retailers can gain the agility to adapt and get ahead, no matter what that change looks like.

Join NCR’s David Wilkinson, President &amp; GM of NCR Retail
and Becca Coggins, Senior Partner at McKinsey for &quot;Change, made simple: How retailers adapt in a shifting environment&quot; &lt;[[https://virtualbigshow.nrf.com/session/change-made-simple-how-retailers-adapt-shifting-environment]]&gt;
Thursday, Jan. 14
1:45 pm – 2:15 pm

We’ll answer pressing industry questions, explore today’s big technology advances in store virtualization, touchless self-checkout and next-generation retail architecture, and discuss why now is the time to invest—not rest.

Don’t wait, add the event to your calendar now. And we’ll “see” you at NRF 2021!
