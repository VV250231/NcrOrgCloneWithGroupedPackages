Interaction – at the ITM

Due to the coronavirus, it can be challenging for financial institutions to offer face-to-face interaction with customers while enabling social distancing.

But one technology that makes it possible in the new normal for banking, is the Interactive Teller Machine or ITM. 

With ITMs, {{company.Company Name:default=your}} customers can speak to a teller via two-way video, providing a visual connection, but in a much lower-contact way. An ITM also enables your tellers to work remotely—helping you keep business continuity at a critical time. 

From reducing wait times and expanding hours to migrating routine, expensive transactions to the self-service channel, they’re fast becoming a key differentiator in a market facing unusual circumstances.
