    <subject>It’s almost time for IRFS NY!</subject>
    <textOnly>We’re excited to be one of the many exhibitors at the International Restaurant &amp; Foodservice Show of New York (IRFS NY), and we hope to see you! Connect with us &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/contact-us]]&gt; prior to the show to our partnership to the next level, and let’s continue the conversation at the show.




	- Why should I attend?


No matter which aspect of the restaurant industry you’re in or what your concept is, there’s something for everyone. Don’t miss out on the chance to learn about all the newest trends, network with your peers and discover ways to grow your business.




	- Where will NCR be? 


We’ll be at Booth 1640. 

We can’t wait to share all the new capabilities we are working on to help you run your restaurants.

If you aren’t able to attend the show, we’d still love to set up some time to stop by your restaurant, catch up and see if we can help you in any way. How’s sometime next week?

Sincerely,

NCR Hospitality
