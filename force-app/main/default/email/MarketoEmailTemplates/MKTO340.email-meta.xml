NCR Travel Kiosk Services Discontinuation
The NCR travel kiosk terminals listed here &lt;[[https://ncr.quickbase.com/up/bqe6gx23b/g/rbp/ek/va/Travel%20Kiosk%20Discontinuation%20Notice.pdf]]&gt; have ended production and are now in “service only mode.” These products will soon reach the “end of service life” (EOL) threshold. If a customer has these units being covered by a service contract, NCR may attempt to extend the service life where possible, although special pricing would apply. Read more. &lt;[[https://ncr.quickbase.com/up/bqe6gx23b/g/rbp/ek/va/Travel%20Kiosk%20Discontinuation%20Notice.pdf]]&gt;

Migration of Aloha Online Ordering to Public Cloud
The migration of Aloha Online Ordering to the public cloud began last week in a phased approach. A communication was sent to all impacted customers explaining the administrative changes they must complete to access Web Admin and Menu Configurator after their Aloha Online Ordering site has been migrated. Please share the detailed instructions located here &lt;[[https://ncr.quickbase.com/up/bqe6gx23b/g/rbn/ek/va/Aloha Online Azure Cloud Migration.docx]]&gt; with your customers about actions that must be completed to ensure there is no disruption when their site is migrated.</textOnly>
