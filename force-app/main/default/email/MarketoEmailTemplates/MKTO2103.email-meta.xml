    <subject>Thank you for attending the NCR Q3 Banking Partner Webcast</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Partners,

I hope you were able to join NCR Q3 Banking Partner Webcast on October 20. We shared several topics to help drive your business, including marketing as a service, solution updates, ITM NextGen, roadmaps, and information on NCR’s company split and Program updates.

If you missed the meeting, I encourage you to watch the replay &lt;[[https://ncr.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCbR6TjM7MDWT8MQphCB84BFDDT3]]&gt; and review the presentation &lt;[[https://ncr.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCH3jbp96Hf39GWW2PdTddWcGcWP]]&gt;.

As always, please reach out to your Channel Account Manager with any questions. As customer needs shift and evolve, we’ll continue to pivot in a way that NCR’s Channel community can drive success and support our shared customers. 

Best regards,

Robert Malik
Global Banking Channel Sales Leader
