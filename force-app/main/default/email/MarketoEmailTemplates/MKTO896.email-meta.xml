    <subject>NACS 2021: Join NCR for the latest intelligence on convenience and fuel retail trends</subject>
    <textOnly>${CTAText2} &lt;[[${CTAURL}?${url-parameter}]]&gt;
Our convenience partners have faced substantial new challenges since we last convened at NACS. Visits to convenience stores are down due to Covid-related safety concerns, changes in EMV payment rules and more. On the upside, c-stores nationwide and globally are responding by adopting new commerce technologies at unprecedented levels. 

Get ahead of technology trends expected to play out over the next couple of years.
 
Join NCR at NACS in Booth #3967 &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/retail/nacs-2021]]&gt;, in the Technology area and learn more about: 



	- Virtualization – Core system upgrades that speed commerce, improve customer service, and lower operating costs.
	- Self-Checkout – POS software and gear that reduces manual tasking to refocus staff to provide the best possible customer service.
	- Business Growth – NCR-led innovations in Loyalty, Food Service and Mobile technologies can help you expand your business at scale.
