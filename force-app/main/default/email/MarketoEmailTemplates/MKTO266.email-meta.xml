    <subject>What Retailers Are Finding in the Run Up to Peak Season</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I know it’s tough to step out of the day-to-day rush of today’s unusual business challenges. 
But peak season is coming and it won’t be like any other. We’re reaching out to all of our retail customers because we know you might need some assistance.
I’d love to help you ensure a smooth peak season and COVID-19 response for your team as well as your customers.
Can you spare 15 minutes? 
At the very least, we can pass of a few insights were learning from other retailers as they move forward.
Thanks!</textOnly>
