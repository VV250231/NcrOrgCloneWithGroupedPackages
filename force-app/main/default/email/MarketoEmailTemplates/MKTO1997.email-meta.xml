    <subject>What’s the best option to modernize your teller system?</subject>
    <textOnly>Should teller systems really be slow, clunky and outdated? The answer is no. But with the majority of financial institutions still using code developed in the 1970s, they will be until the decision is taken to modernize.
 
Your bankers today are more comfortable with modern, digital technologies that are easy and intuitive to use – but they’re having to work with 50-year-old technology that just doesn’t cut it.
 
With our new 
cloud-native teller services you can deliver a modern UI for you staff, connect all your banking channels and easily integrate new services.

Watch our video to see how NCR Channel Services Platform can transform and connect your technology.
