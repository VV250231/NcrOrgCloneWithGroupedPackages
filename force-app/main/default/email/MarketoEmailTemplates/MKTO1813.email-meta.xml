    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
Continuously improving our customers’ experience remains one of NCR’s top priorities. That’s why we take your feedback seriously and are asking you to take the NCR Customer Satisfaction Survey 2022. We’d appreciate receiving your insights into your relationship with NCR, including the Cardtronics and Allpoint Network relationships you may have. You‘ll receive the survey link from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt; in the next few days.
 
I hope you’ll take our survey and share your honest opinion with us. Your feedback is essential for improving our offerings, which can help you run your business better.
 
Thank you for being an NCR customer. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Don Layden 
President
