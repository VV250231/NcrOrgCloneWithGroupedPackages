    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=NCR Aloha Customer}}
Historically, Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover make adjustments to their interchange fees each year in April and October. These brands recently announced they were not making adjustments to their fees until April 2022. Some processors however have announced that they are making changes and increasing their fees for non-EMV processed transactions. 

This notification is to make sure that you are watching your payments statements for potential rate increases in the next couple of months. NCR does provide payment processing and we can conduct a complementary analysis on your existing statement to discuss potential savings that are available. 

If you are interested in a complementary statement analysis, please click below. We will have a member from our team reach out to you shortly to review your processing statement.
