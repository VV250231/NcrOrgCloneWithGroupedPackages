    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
At NCR, we remain committed to enabling simple, made possible for our customers.

We have sent an invite to take our annual customer 
feedback survey from customer.success@feedback.ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:customer.success@feedback.ncr.com]]&gt;, which will only take a few minutes of your time.

As I shared in my recent note to you, we are striving to make improvements on the topics you highlighted during last year’s survey, including customer service, onboarding process and availability and 
quality of software and hardware solutions. And we want to know how we are doing. Your input will help us learn how we are performing in those areas and how else we can continue to improve.

If you haven’t already, please consider taking the survey so we can learn from your valuable insights. I appreciate your feedback and, as always, thank you for being an NCR customer.

Warmest regards,

Frank Hauck
President &amp; General Manager, NCR Banking
