    <subject>Stalled Deployment? Brand New Offers to Get Your Project Moving</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},


I’m Jimmy Staiti and I’m your business development rep.
 
Many of our customers delayed IT deployments during the first few months of COVID, but are realizing they need to accelerate those deployments now.
 
To help, NCR is offering a suite of project deployment offerings at promotional rates for the remainder of 2020.
 
I&apos;d love to talk through the details with you.
 
Please let me know if you have time for a quick phone call this Thursday or Friday?


Thanks!
