    <textOnly>What’s new in NCR channel sales? Finishing 2022 
strong!
Dear Valued Channel Partners,
 
As 2022 draws to a close, the NCR team would like to thank you for 
another great year — your expertise and commitment to our shared customers have been vital to achieving continued success. The following highlights are the latest updates from our global channel community: 

Industry updates
 
Our Banking channel 
partners are on track to beat their 2022 revenue goals and are laying the foundation for continued growth by allocating 100% of market development funds (MDF), globally. We also have an enablement program in development for channel partners to provide ITM integration services.
In Retail, we have engaged our regional Inside Sales teams to better engage our Latin America 
channel partners, providing more structured training and enablement to drive more sales. Our channel partners also continue helping customers evolve and transform the shopping experience by closing new and organic self-checkout deals around the globe.
In Hospitality, several North America channel partners have closed their first Aloha Cloud opportunities. Latin America channel partners grew the total number of Aloha sites by 10% in Q3 2022 alone, while in Europe, Middle East and Africa, channel partners have achieved 27% year on year (YoY) growth in cloud-based revenue.
Progress on channel partner engagement revitalization
Earlier this year, we shared that we had undertaken an important initiative to improve the end-to-end channel partner experience with NCR. Based on your feedback, we have been working on improvements across the following areas:
Since our last update, we have begun work on revamping our channel partner certification and channel partner contracting processes to make it clearer, faster and simpler to onboard 
and begin selling NCR solutions. We have also enhanced our reporting capabilities to provide deeper insights that help analyze and strategically drive your business. In addition, we recently launched a new feature in the NCR Partner Network Resource Center dashboard, detailing revenue details by product/solution type (see image below). This helps you and your teams stay current in tracking your year-to-date performance. We look forward to sharing more improvements with you as we continue working on enhancing channel partner engagement.
What’s next? — Virtual Channel Sales Kickoff 2023
Are you ready to reconnect as a global channel community? We are! Please be on the lookout for a save-the-date invitation, which will be coming in January for our virtual NCR Global Channel Sales 
Kickoff in early 2023. During our kickoff, we will be discussing in more detail how our Transform. Connect. Run. &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEYiHOO_1HE]]&gt; strategy helps unlock more opportunities and meet the changing needs of the market. Channel partner business planning sessions will soon follow so we can all be aligned on where we need to put our focus to win together in the upcoming year.
Questions?
If you have any questions or need additional information, please reach out to your channel account manager or email ChannelSales.NCR@ncr.com. We look forward to working with you in the year ahead and appreciate your continued commitment and collaboration.

Have a safe and happy holiday season,
The NCR Partner Network Team
