    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
We take your feedback seriously, and this year we are again asking you for your input in our 2021 Customer Satisfaction Survey. Your voice is important as we continue to simplify how we operate, innovate and create more value for your business.

Focused on continuous improvement, we act on your feedback to enhance the NCR customer experience. I am pleased to share that the actions we have taken on previous survey results have created positive progress in our overall customer satisfaction. For example, we saw a double-digit improvement in customer satisfaction related to invoicing, and we continue to establish programs to accelerate customer service response times and elevate product quality.

In the next few days, we will send you our 2021 Customer Satisfaction Survey. I hope that you will once again take the survey and let us know what is on your mind. Your feedback is essential as we continue to focus on our customers and improve our service.

Thank you for being a customer of NCR. I look forward to hearing from you. 

My best,

Frank Hauck
President &amp; General Manager, Global Banking
