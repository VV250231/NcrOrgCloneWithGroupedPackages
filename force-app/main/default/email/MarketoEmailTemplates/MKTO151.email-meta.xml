    <subject>Your Pending Order with NCR</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

You may have experienced an issue recently while attempting to place your order through MyNCR—we&apos;re sorry for that inconvenience. We’re happy to let you know the issue has been fixed and you can now place your order.

You can use the same link that we emailed previously to see your order and complete the checkout process.

You can also access MyNCR directly by clicking here &lt;[[http://myncr.ncr.com/]]&gt; and logging in. Once logged in, you can click the Start Ordering button, choose your legal entity (if applicable) and click the Pending Orders button to proceed with your order.

 Your experience is important to us. If you have any further issues or concerns, please contact us at MyNCR.Administrator@ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:MyNCR.Administrator@ncr.com]]&gt;.

Thank you,
The NCR Team</textOnly>
