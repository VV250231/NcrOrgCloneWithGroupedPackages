    <textOnly>Dear Valued NCR Customer:    
 
Previously, NCR notified you of plans to migrate Command Center from our on-premises data center to the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform. This is to notify you that your sites have been identified for migration to Azure. This migration will include both a CMCAgent version upgrade and migration to our Command Center environment in Azure public cloud.To prepare for the migration, you will need to allowlist specific NCR endpoints. Instructions to do so are included below. 
 
If your company was previously migrated: 
You are receiving this notification because your company still has some stores remaining online in the on-premises data center (DFW05) which will be included in this migration. 
 
If your company uses Aloha EDC for payments and the saved card functionality in Aloha Digital Ordering or Aloha Online Ordering: 
After your stores are migrated, guests with previously saved credit cards in their profile will need to 
re-enter their card information to save it to their profile 
 
If your site fails to migrate successfully, saved card functionality for saving new cards or retrieving previously saved cards will no longer work until the site is successfully migrated. 
 
ACTION REQUIRED: 
You must ensure that you allowlist the NCR endpoints to prepare for the migration, or you will be at risk of losing access to your licensed NCR products that are being migrated to Microsoft Azure 
Public Cloud. See the full list of NUA01 Public Endpoints per Application. &lt;[[https://go.ncr.com/rs/605-BQY-740/images/Command Center Firewall Requirements.pdf]]&gt;
 
If you are a Command Center user, you will need to download the Command Center client 
using this link and instructions &lt;[[https://go.ncr.com/rs/605-BQY-740/images/CMC Client Migration - NUA01-SEC.pdf]]&gt; provided to access your migrated sites. 
 

Additional information on the migration process can be found here &lt;[[https://go.ncr.com/rs/605-BQY-740/images/Command Center Migration.pdf]]&gt;. 

TIMING: 
Migration window: February 28

WHAT TO EXPECT: 
NCR has already deployed the CMCreqcheck.exe software to test and confirm that your site(s) can access the new endpoint. Sites identified for migration will have their CMCAgent upgraded prior to the targeted window noted above. 

Thank you for your continued cooperation. Please contact NCR Customer Support if you have any questions or experience any issues, so we can assist you as quickly as possible.
