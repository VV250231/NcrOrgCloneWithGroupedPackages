Command Center Client and Secure Access, Version # 19.2.3
About this Release
This release is a maintenance update of the Command Center and Secure Access Clients 19.2 General Release. This Client-only release is specifically being provided in the Azure US Data Center (NUA01-SEC) for easing the userâ€™s migration experience into the new data center.
Enhancements
Improved User Accessibility to Azure NUA01-SEC
Allows for a non-admin user to login to the (19.2.3 or higher) 
Command Center and Secure Access clients after having installed or upgraded as an admin privileged user.

Updated the default data center for startup of the client after installation to now be the Azure NUA01-SEC data center. This default is only used if all else fails, allowing the client to provide feedback to the user to investigate an installation failure.

Notes
