    <subject>Update from Customer Survey Results</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
At NCR, we remain focused on the success of our customers. Your input helps us learn how we can further improve the solutions we offer you. 

As Mike Hayford shared in his note to you, we are excited that you have seen a very positive improvement in your customer experience based on the 2020 Customer Satisfaction survey results. 

Based on your responses to the survey, we’re focusing on the following areas within the Banking business unit:



	- 

Drive outstanding customer service by improving resolution time, creating additional self-service capabilities and automating our processes so you have access to the most up-to-date features and the most contemporary user experience.

	- 

Simplify the onboarding process by streamlining deployments, resulting in a faster solution implementation time.

	- Improve the availability and quality of software and hardware solutions by standardizing our global offerings, simplifying the software distribution process and continuously improving our ITM/ATM field performance levels.


We strive to achieve substantial improvement in these areas over the course of 2021. We invite you to continue to share your feedback in the 2021 Customer Survey process to let us know how we’re doing. 
 
Thank you again for being an NCR customer and for sharing your feedback with us.

Best regards,

Frank Hauck
President, NCR Banking
