    <subject>NCR RaaS Support Update</subject>
    <textOnly>To Our Franchise Community
We hope you received our update that we shared on NCR RaaS (DUMAC) support a couple of weeks back. As mentioned in that communication, our initial focus was to strengthen the support organization. Following that, we formulated a plan to improve our operations, installation and implementation teams.

NCR recognizes that our performance on the installation &amp; implementation teams has deteriorated over the past few months. However, with the improvement plan that we have put in place, we are confident that you will start seeing an improvement in our timeliness 
and quality of installs. The following is a recap of the effort thus far: 



	- Performance issues are largely driven by staffing gaps and attrition. We are working aggressively to close the gaps.  


	- We lost a few senior technicians/installers during the integration of the DUMAC hospitality business into NCR, but we were able to hire an equivalent number of senior experienced installers to the team and all have been successfully onboarded 
	- We are in the process of hiring 8 additional individuals to work as technicians, trainers &amp; leaders to support our existing staging, warehouse, scheduling and installation teams 
	- The entire RaaS leadership team is aligned with their counterparts on the NCR team to enable better integration and collaboration within the teams  




	- We have setup the RaaS team to leverage the broader NCR ecosystem  


	- Leveraging senior technical and hands-on resources from the broader NCR pool of resources, to support installs  
	- Engage contractors leveraging NCRs relationship with a vast number of 3rd party partners, as needed, depending upon the location  




	- We have successfully enabled the RaaS team to order parts &amp; equipment from NCR systems directly, to shorten the timeline for procuring them and getting it to our customers   


	- With the transition to NCR’s incident management system (NEOS), the support team can start leveraging the direct access to field techs to handle any dispatches for onsite support – this will be enabled in the next few weeks 




	- While our warehouse and staging facility in Syracuse is the primary location for RaaS, we are working on leveraging NCRs Nashville warehouse for simple installs (where need for staging is minimal to none)  




	- Finally, we are working on identifying targeted KPIs for installs and implementation team that we can start tracking to measure the quality and performance of the team  



If you have any questions or concerns, or if there is ever an escalation needed on your behalf, please feel free to contact us directly for help.Best,
