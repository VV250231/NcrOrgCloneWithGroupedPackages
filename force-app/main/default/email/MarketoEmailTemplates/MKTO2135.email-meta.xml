    <subject>NCR Aloha Cloud Pilot 6.4 is Here</subject>
    <textOnly>A new version of Aloha Cloud is now available as a pilot. With Version 6.4, you can:



	- Join the Merchant Cost Savings Program: A credit card surcharge of up to 4% is now supported for customers on the connected payments gateway. To see if this is allowed in your state, visit the V/MC PCI site. You&apos;ll be responsible for providing signage when enabling the feature. Manual Card entry is not supported for the surcharge refund; the card must be present until update 6.5.




	- Add Nested Modifiers: You can now add up to 2 layers of modifiers to items in your menu. You can turn on this setting in your Back Office. In order to make modifiers, you&apos;ll add a modifier item such as &quot;Fries&quot;. You can then add a modifier group to the item, like &quot;Fry Type&quot;. When you search for the original item (&quot;Fries&quot;) in the Back Office, assign it to the modifier group (&quot;Fry Type&quot;), to add the nested modifier.




	- Send Voids to the Kitchen: After you&apos;ve closed a ticket, you can now send voids to the kitchen by checking the box in the Back Office. The point-of-sale, kitchen display system and receipt will show that the order was voided.




	- Own multiple barcodes: Aloha Cloud now supports adding up to four barcodes to the same item. This helps when you purchase an item from more than one vendor under a different bar code. Scanning any one of the barcodes through a scanner connected to the POS adds the item to the guest check.




	- Run your store cashless: You can now have a restaurant that only uses non-cash payments. This option can be selected in the Aloha Cloud Back Office settings: choose &quot;Payments,&quot; then go to the &quot;Accepted Payment Methods.&quot; From there, uncheck the &quot;Cash&quot; box and save. This will disable cash payments for the entire restaurant.



How to Request the UpdateIf you would like to request access to this pilot release, please contact Customer Support at 877-270-3475. If you&apos;re approved to receive the update, your system will update to the pilot automatically 
once it&apos;s available if you have automatic updates enabled. If you don&apos;t have automatic updates enabled, you can update to 6.4 by tapping the “Upgrade” button from the cloud icon on the POS.
Note: You can restrict POS updates until it&apos;s the right time to update by disabling the &quot;POS Upgrade&quot; permission in the Aloha Cloud Back Office.

Mac 
Mini Version Support
We are no longer supporting Mac Mini servers on macOS v10.9 or older*. If you use a Mac Mini server with your Aloha Cloud 
solution, you will need to be on a higher version of macOS before you update to Aloha Cloud v6.4. If your macOS version is out of date, 
it will affect your ability to manage tickets and send them to the kitchen. To get the best experience with Aloha Cloud:


	- Update the OS software, if supported
	- Purchase a newer Mac Mini that can support the latest macOS versions


*Mac Mini macOS versions that are currently supported are: Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, and 
Ventura.
