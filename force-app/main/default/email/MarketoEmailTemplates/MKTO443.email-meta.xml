    <subject>Get Help Applying for your SBA Small Business Protection Loan</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/?${url-parameter}]]&gt;
Last week, the federal government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act that allocates funding to support the U.S. economy, including small businesses.  

 It provides cash-flow assistance for small businesses (under 500 employees) through 100% federally guaranteed loans to employers who maintain their payroll during this emergency.  

 If your eligible small business retains your average prior payroll, the portion of the loan used for payroll costs and other qualifying expenses will be forgiven. 

If you would like to apply for a loan, you have multiple options:


	- Check with your local bank to see if they are providing SBA loans 
	- Use NCR’s new partnership with Nymbus &lt;[[http://www.nymbus.com]]&gt;, a financial services provider, to get help applying for Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection loans—it helps you submit SBA applications without the overhead normally required



 Loan specialists at Nymbus can help guide you through the loan process.  Get more information on the Paycheck Protection Program and Nymbus, including a link to a loan application,  here &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/nymbus-smb-relief?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=landingpage&amp;utm_campaign=NYMBUS_partnership]]&gt;.


We’ve also established a coronavirus pandemic resource center &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus]]&gt;, including a page on the United States’ federal disaster response legislation &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/federal-disaster-response-stimulus]]&gt;, to make it easy to find COVID-19 resources, tools, kits and articles.   
Please know we’re here to support you in any way we can. This crisis emphasizes our ability as an industry to come together for unity and partnership. And we’ll get through this together.
Thank you for being our customer.


Sincerely,
Dirk Izzo
