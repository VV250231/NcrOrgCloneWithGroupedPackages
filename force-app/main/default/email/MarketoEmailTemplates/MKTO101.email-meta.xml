    <subject>Our NCR community is here to support you</subject>
    <textOnly>To our valued clients, 

The protests in the United States in response to recent events and injustice are creating a dialogue about the way we need to treat our neighbors that is spreading around the world. While tragic events were the catalyst for this, it is my hope that as a nation, and a global community, that we will emerge stronger.
Our CEO, Mike Hayford, sent a note to our NCR community &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/company/responding-to-injustice-as-one-global-community]]&gt; yesterday that we felt should be posted for all to see. I want you to know that our company is global, diverse and inclusive, but simply having a diverse employee base is not enough. It starts with our leadership team and requires action.
I hope you’ll take a moment to read Mike’s letter, know that we are proud to call you our customer and that we are here to support you as one NCR team.
