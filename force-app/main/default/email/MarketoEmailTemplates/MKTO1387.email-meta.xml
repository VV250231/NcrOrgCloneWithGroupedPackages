    <subject>IFRS NY – Here We Come!</subject>
    <textOnly>It’s almost here! We’re excited to be a part of the action at the International Restaurant &amp; Foodservice Show this year. As a tech company, we’ll be showcasing our solutions that help you run your restaurants with ease. Starting at $0 per month, our starter package has everything you need from email marketing to POS to payment processing. 
 
If you’re attending the show, stop and see us at Booth 1640. We’ve worked with local restaurants in NY like Mr. Chow, BonChon and Alicart Group to increase their sales, kitchen capacity and proven growth in their business.       

If you aren’t able to attend the show, we’d still love to set up some time to stop by your restaurant, catch up and see if we can help you in any way. How about we grab 15 minutes next week?

Sincerely,

NCR Hospitality
