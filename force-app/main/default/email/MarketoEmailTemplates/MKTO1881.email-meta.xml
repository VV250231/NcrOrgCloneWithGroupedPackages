    <subject>Customer Success Story: This Could Be You</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 

Convenience stores need to be built for the future, and Cencosud was ready to provide an innovative and convenient shopping experience.

Cencosud wanted to ensure their Spid Convenience store offered 
customers a level of speed and convenience they could not get anywhere else. With NCR, Cencosud harnessed the latest technology to deliver a fast, convenient omnichannel approach. 

From the Cencosud team: “The greatest impact has been to have an excellent and fast customer experience which values our customers’ time and provides a 100% self-service store.”
