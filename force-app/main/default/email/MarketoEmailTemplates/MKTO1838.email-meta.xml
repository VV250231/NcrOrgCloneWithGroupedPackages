    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 

At NACS earlier this month, you saw our approach to Transform, Connect, and Run your technology platform.

 As convenience fuel retail continues to innovate, we highlighted the benefits and outcomes of implementing these specific 
solutions:


	- 
Self-checkout

	- Point-of-sale 
(POS)
	- Loyalty
	- Cloud Based 
Analytics
	- Food service and 
more


By modernizing your 
store technology, you can improve your use of staff, increase efficiency and offer your customers the flexible shopping experience they desire.
