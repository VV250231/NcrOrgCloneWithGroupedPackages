    <subject>One Unsubtle Way Your Financial Institution Captures Attention</subject>
    <textOnly>As consumers we’re inundated by advertising constantly - when we’re walking down the street, taking the bus, streaming TV or just enjoying some music. Most of the time, we tune it out.

But there’s one place we DON’T tune out: at the ATM.

Because at the ATM, you’re dealing with your money. So you focus intently on that screen until your transaction is finished.

You’re a captive audience.

It’s why recall with ATM screen advertising is much higher than other mediums. 

See how to take advantage of this unique opportunity at your ATMs to create new and lasting relationships — in our new blog.
