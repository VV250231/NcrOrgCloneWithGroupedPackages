    <subject>NCR Aloha Cloud Pilot 6.4 is Here</subject>
    <textOnly>A new version of Aloha Cloud is now available as a pilot. With Version 6.4, your merchants can:



	- Join the Merchant Cost Savings Program: A credit card surcharge of up to 4% is now supported for merchants who&apos;re on the connected payments gateway. They can visit the V/MC PCI site to see if it&apos;s available in their state. Your merchants will be responsible for providing signage when enabling the feature. Manual Card entry is not supported for the surcharge refund; the card must be present until update 6.5.




	- Add Nested Modifiers: Merchants can now add up to 2 layers of modifiers to items in their menu. They can turn on this setting in the Back Office. In order to make modifiers, they&apos;ll add a modifier item such as &quot;Fries&quot;. They can then add a modifier group to the item, like &quot;Fry Type&quot;. When they search for the original item (&quot;Fries&quot;) in the Back Office, assign it to the modifier group (&quot;Fry Type&quot;), to add the nested modifier.




	- Send Voids to the Kitchen: After merchants have closed a ticket, they can now send voids to the kitchen by checking the box in the Back Office. The point-of-sale, kitchen display system and receipt will show that the order was voided.




	- Own multiple barcodes: Aloha Cloud now supports adding up to four barcodes to the same item. This helps when merchants purchase an item from more than one vendor under a different bar code. Scanning any one of the barcodes through a scanner connected to the POS adds the item to the guest check.




	- Run your store cashless: Merchants can now have a restaurant that only uses non-cash payments. This option can be selected in the Aloha Cloud Back Office settings: choose &quot;Payments,&quot; then go to the &quot;Accepted Payment Methods.&quot; From there, uncheck the &quot;Cash&quot; box and save. This will disable cash payments for the entire restaurant.



Mac Mini Version Support
Note: We are no longer supporting Mac Mini servers on macOS v10.9 or older*. If your merchants use a Mac Mini server with their Aloha Cloud solution, they&apos;ll need to be on a higher version of macOS before they update to Aloha Cloud v6.4. If their macOS version is out of date, it will affect their ability to manage tickets and send them to the kitchen. To get the best experience with Aloha Cloud, they&apos;ll need to:



	- Update the OS software, if supported
	- Purchase a newer Mac Mini that can support the latest macOS versions



*Mac Mini macOS versions that are currently supported are: Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura.
