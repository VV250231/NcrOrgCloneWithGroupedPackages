    <subject>Price Increase Notification for all NCR Services</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer,
 
This communication is to provide you advance notice of an 5% CPI base increase effective as of January 1, 2023, for all NCR Services. This price increase is based on the most recent available data from the CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. city average – All Items for the 12-month period ending July-2022. Depending on your contract, you may have additional language associated with price increases and any such terms will be reflected accordingly in the final price increase beginning in 2023.
 
Due to high inflation, the market is ever-changing, and these changes have caused price increases in materials, staff and maintaining the high quality we provide to you. We understand the effect price increases can have on our customers. We value your business and look forward to your continued support. 

Sincerely,
NCR
