    <subject>We Are Acting On Your Feedback</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
At NCR, we are focused on the success of our customers. Your input helps us learn how we can make simple possible for you and further improve the service and solutions we offer. 

As CEO Mike Hayford shared in his recent note, we are excited to see improvement in our most recent Customer Satisfaction survey results. This is gratifying given the challenging year we all experienced, during which we hope NCR was a strong support to you. However, there is always room to do better, and we continue to listen to your feedback to identify areas for improvement. 

Based on your responses to the survey, we’re focusing on two key themes within the Hospitality business:



	- Simplification: You asked us to simplify our processes and make it easier to use and manage your NCR solutions. Additionally, you want us to make the implementation of new software or hardware more efficient and improve how we invoice for the services you buy from NCR.


	- Key focus areas of our simplification efforts are implementation, customer support and invoicing.






	- Communication: We need to be more proactive and transparent in our communications with you. When there is a change in our organization, we must ensure you know your new contacts. When you have an open issue, you want us to proactively notify you and keep you apprised of progress. 


	- I have challenged our teams to not only improve, but also innovate how we proactively deliver the information you need when you need it.




We aim to drive substantial improvement in these areas in 2021. I will share specific action plans and our progress on each throughout the year. 
 
Thank you for being an NCR customer and for sharing your feedback with us.

Warmest regards,

Dirk Izzo
President and General Manager, NCR Hospitality
