    <textOnly>What’s New in Channel? September 
2022
Dear Valued Channel Partners,
 
As mentioned in our last email, we are eager to communicate with our 
Channel community with more frequency and to keep everyone more connected and informed. 

Here we’d like to share some quick highlights from the industries we serve, and a spotlight on our Partner Assist resource, our dedicated Channel support team:
 
In BANKING, Partners are 
fueling high-octane performance, increasing Subscription &amp; SaaS sales in alignment with NCR’s strategic initiatives and tracking to beat 2022 revenue goals
Our RETAIL Partners are supporting additional strategic initiatives with 90% of 
all sales from Preferred Offers and SCO sales up YoY in every region, driving Store Transformation
In HOSPITALITY, 80% of our business closed in NAMER is with our aaS platforms and we held an immersion training for our Partners this summer for our Aloha Cloud product line (quick fact: Aloha turns 30 this 
year!)
