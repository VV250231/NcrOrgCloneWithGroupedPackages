    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 

David Bone here from NCR Freshop. Did you receive the Video Mailer I sent you last week? What did you think?

Many retailers rushed to adopt an eCommerce solution during the pandemic. Now that the world has opened back up, is it time to re-evaluate the effectiveness of that solution? NCR Freshop allows retailers to move from adoption to adaptation of a more profitable and service-driven eCommerce model.

We’d like to help you accomplish this by offering an eCommerce Assessment: our team with 
decades of grocery expertise will evaluate your current eCommerce operation, then will strategize &amp; consult with you on best practices for your future digital engagement.

Consulting firms charge up to $25.5k for a full ecommerce assessment, like the one NCR Freshop is exclusively offering – but at zero cost to you or your organization. Let us be your partner to lead you into the future of eCommerce.
