    <subject>Add Contactless Order &amp; Pay for Your Guests Now</subject>
    <textOnly>You’re trying to make up lost revenue and get new guests in the door or at your curb. They’re feeling cagey about touching surfaces and interacting with people.

But you can make {{company.Company Name:default=your restaurant}}’s experience safer with Aloha’s new contactless curbside and contactless dine-in experiences.
 
Online, guests can go to your site and order for touchless takeout.

On site, they scan a QR code at the table to see the menu, order and 
pay – from their phones.

This can help you increase service speed, order accuracy and table turns and provide a safer experience that gives guests the confidence to come back.

Do you have time on your calendar to discuss? One of our NCR Aloha restaurant consultants will be following up with you in the next week or you can sign up for our waitlist.
