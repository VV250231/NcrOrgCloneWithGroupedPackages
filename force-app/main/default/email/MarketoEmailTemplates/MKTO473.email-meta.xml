    <subject>New Article: What Does Digital-First Banking *Mean*?</subject>
    <textOnly>You’ve tried curbside delivery—right? You start grocery shopping online or maybe you place an order on your phone for that amazing Thai place down the street.

When it’s ready, you get an alert, pop over to the physical location and grab your order.

It’s easy to see why consumer demand for this is at an all-time high.

Now, it’s happening in banking, too. And as an FI, you’re facing an urgent need to connect your customers’ digital and physical experiences into a single, seamless journey.

Enable users to start a transaction, loan application or even an appointment with one of your bankers online or on mobile and finish it in-branch…or vice versa.

Digital banking demands change. And in this new series from NCR, we’ll help you understand the strategies, technologies and journeys required for success. 

Start with our first article &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/blogs/banking/how-fis-are-accelerating-the-journey-to-digital-first-banking]]&gt;, which explores how FIs are 
accelerating their digital-first journey to boost profits and give customers the experience they prefer.
