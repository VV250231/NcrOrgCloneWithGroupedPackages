    <subject>Animation: See how the NCR SelfServ 21 works</subject>
    <textOnly>Don’t be fooled by the compact size of the NCR SelfServ 21. It’s one of our most powerful lobby dispensers to ever hit the market. 

Powered by our innovative S2 Media Dispense Module, the SelfServ 21 provides market-leading cassette capacity—including both four- and five- high configurations—giving increased availability and uptime. 

Plus its enhanced security innovations increase protection against cash-trap attacks, transaction-reversal fraud and card-skimming fraud too. 

Watch the animation to see the SelfServ 21 in action — and with NCR ATM as a Service we can help you run your ATM network better than ever before.
