    <subject>2023 Move to Quarterly Billing</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 

In response to requests and to bring higher quality and more timely invoicing, NCR will transition your recurring services to quarterly billing in 2023. This change will allow NCR to validate billings and increase accuracy. The separation between billing cycles will also enable the customer success team more time to answer your questions. The delivery date for the first quarterly billing is March 2023, and we plan to move to advance billing by the end of the year. 

Please make any necessary adjustments to plan for the new quarterly billing cycle. To ensure invoice accuracy, please provide us with, at minimum, an advance 30-day written notification of any site-level changes. If you have any questions on this change in billing cycle, please reach out to the customer success team at WendysRaaS.ClientServices@ncr.com or visit MyNCR &lt;[[https://go.ncr.com/rs/605-BQY-740/images/myncr-login-instructions.pdf]]&gt; to pay, view or download your invoices. 

We look forward to helping you run your business. 

Sincerely,
NCR
