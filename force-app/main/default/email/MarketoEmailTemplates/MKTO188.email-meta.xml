    <subject>We Are Acting On Your Feedback</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

At NCR, we are committed to taking care of our customers through innovation and reliability. Your feedback helps us learn how we can make your restaurant run simpler and safer by optimizing every aspect of your business and advancing the solutions we offer. 

So far, 2020 has been anything but normal, but we want you to know that we haven’t lost sight of your feedback from our regular customer satisfaction survey last year. Based on your responses, we’ve been focused on the following within the Hospitality business unit: 



	- Better support for our customers. Whether you are a global chain or a local neighborhood restaurant, we want you to feel like NCR’s only customer and receive world-class service. Based on your feedback, we have already invested in training and knowledge transfer between our support and Aloha product teams, which has enabled us to improve response time to more quickly strengthen your operations. In addition, we are focused on increasing our service levels, the number of calls we can resolve the first time, decreasing call handling time and providing direct access to product expertise. We want the result to be less time on the phone with us and more time serving your customers.




	- Simplicity of doing business with NCR. By creating new solution “bundles” that include hardware, software and service for one monthly subscription, we have simplified and reduced the effort required by our customers to manage their business with us, as well as streamlined service delivery by NCR. And by further investing in the technology required to bring all of our customers into one management platform, we are able to streamline our processes, resulting in a more efficient and consistent relationship management experience for our customers.




	- Advancing the Aloha platform. In 2020, we have increased our investment in research and development in features that will enable you to optimize your business and meet your guests’ new expectations. New contactless payment, contactless dine-in and consumer marketing capabilities are now available in certain markets. We are advancing NCR Payments and add-on components to the Aloha platform, specifically the order and delivery capabilities so important in today’s restaurant market, while using our API-first approach to simplify the upgrade process and connectivity to third-party applications. Based on these investments across the Aloha platform, we have improved software quality by 47% to date and our backlog of defects for Aloha Mobile has declined 17%. We will continue to focus on driving more progress in these areas, which will translate into improved product quality and the need for fewer calls to our support desk.




	- Improving hardware delivery. Our goal is to shorten lead times, improve quality and deliver excellent service. As an example, we improved our hardware delivery significantly and are now delivering On Time and In Full (OTIF) 90% of the time. We have launched a new raw materials stocking strategy and launched Preferred Offers that reduce our product mix with a target of further improving on time delivery by 2% each quarter to achieve a 98% OTIF by year end.


Enhancing our customer experience and improving service levels remains a top priority for NCR, and we want you to know how we are doing. NCR leads with a customer-first approach and our employees are empowered to do what it takes to align with your business priorities and make it easier to do business with us while enabling you to satisfy your customers’ requirements. 

Later this year, we will conduct our Customer Satisfaction Survey again and we encourage you to participate and provide your valuable feedback. 

Thank you for being an NCR customer and for sharing your insights with us.

Warmest regards,

Dirk Izzo 
SVP and General Manager, NCR Hospitality
