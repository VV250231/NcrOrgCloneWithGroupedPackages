    <subject>Targeting Your Rival‘s Customers at Your ATMs</subject>
    <textOnly>With people accustomed to dynamic personalization everywhere in their lives, how can you ensure it happens at your ATMs?

The power comes from using software to segment customer data and share hyper-relevant, 
contextual marketing that helps you drive revenue.

Think: travel insurance in the summer. Retirement planning for over-60 consumers. Credit cards with low interest rates near Christmas. 

You can even target your competitors’ customers. 

Did a rival financial institution just raise their loan interest rates? That makes it a great time to advertise your rates.

See what else is possible—and simple to do—in our latest eBook on ATM marketing.
