    <subject>How are you bridging the “digital divide”?</subject>
    <textOnly>India and Southeast Asia are some of the fastest growing regions in the world when it comes to digital adoption. But they also have one of the largest underbanked populations with many remote consumers unable to access a branch or stable internet connectivity. 

That’s why cash and access to it remains in large demand.
 
As governments put pressure on financial institutions to better support rural communities, how best can they bridge the digital divide without affecting their digital-first reputation?
 
Explore how self-service solutions are key to customer inclusion for the unbanked, underbanked and digital-first 
consumers.
