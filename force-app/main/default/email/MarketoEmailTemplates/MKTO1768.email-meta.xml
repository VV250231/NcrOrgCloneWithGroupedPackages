    <textOnly>NCR customers and partners,
 
On September 27th we go live with a new ticketing system, SalesForce Service Cloud, as part of the launch of NCR Support Hub. The migration will bring with it many benefits that will improve your overall customer experience.
 
As a current report recipient, there will be a change in your subscribed reports. Starting on September 27th, you will receive a NEW ‘All Metrics Case Report’ reflecting the same fields/measures.
 
The report will contain a tabular view of Case Information + Resolution Categories for the Customer Accounts (MCNs) you have access to. 
 
Additionally, with our transition, there will be slight discrepancies in the support data over the next two weeks as we migrate all case information into the new platform. The ‘Daily’ report will be most affected by this as the source for these reports will be split between 2 applications next week. Then over the weekend of Oct 1, we will transition all data to the new tool, making the reports whole again. 
 
Please reach out to your NCR Customer Success Manager or Account Executive for more information or email hospitality.supportenablement@ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:hospitality.supportenablement@ncr.com]]&gt;. 
 
Thank you for being patient with us through this transition and your continued partnership with NCR.
 
Sincerely,
 
NCR</textOnly>
