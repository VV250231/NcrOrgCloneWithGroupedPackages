    <textOnly>Until recently, the ATM has sat in its own silo, providing transaction services to customers.  

But not anymore.

Now, the ATM is an access point for a whole range of banking services, which means it needs to integrate with all kinds of systems, from the core to third-parties via open banking.


It needs an agile, innovative operating platform that makes it simple to add new services and future innovations.


That platform is our new Activate Enterprise NextGen. See why it’s changing everything, in the best way.
