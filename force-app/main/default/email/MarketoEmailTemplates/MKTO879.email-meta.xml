    <subject>Your Digital Online Ordering Migration has been Delayed</subject>
    <textOnly>An unexpected delay came up with your Digital Online Ordering transition, 
pushing it back to next week, September 1, 2021.

Thanks for being patient while we sort this out.
This transition will still take place during maintenance hours, so there’s no impact to your service. 

Our relationship is extremely important to us, and we never want our errors to set you off track. 

You’ll be migrated next week with new features to make sure you’re back on track to better serve your customers ASAP. 

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
