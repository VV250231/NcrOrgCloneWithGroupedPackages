    <subject>Thanks for visiting us at Fast Casual Executive Summit</subject>
    <textOnly>Thank you for joining us at this year’s Fast Casual Executive Summit. We hope you were able to learn, connect and network, just like we did. And, we enjoyed sharing how NCR can help run your restaurant from end-to-end.

To learn more about how NCR’s digital-first solutions can help you connect with your guests, simplify operations and reduce costs, contact us &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/restaurants/contact-us]]&gt; today. No risk, no hard sell—just information.

And, if you didn’t get the chance to see it, be sure to watch the video “Getting Down to Business with Contactless &lt;[[https://vimeo.com/473632695/ef2cbfbcb0]]&gt;.” In it, Dirk Izzo, president and general manager of NCR Hospitality, talks with executives from Fazoli’s Restaurant Group, 
Firehouse Subs and Ballard Brands about how they’ve been reimagining the customer experience through contactless options that don’t strain their business operations. 

Check it out here &lt;[[https://vimeo.com/473632695/ef2cbfbcb0]]&gt;</textOnly>
