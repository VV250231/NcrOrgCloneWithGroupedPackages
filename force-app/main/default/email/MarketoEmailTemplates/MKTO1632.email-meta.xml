    <textOnly>Although branch numbers decline at pace, anyone who thinks the branch is dead does so at their peril. Customers still want that physical presence, the security and support of their own financial institution (FI) – only what they want from the branch is shifting. 

Consumers are increasingly content with performing everyday transactions using self-directed channels like mobile and online. But when it comes to more complex transactions or the need for financial advice or consultancy, they want that face-to-face connection. 

So FIs are shaking up the traditional branch using innovative formats to meet the needs of the customer, deliver great experiences and shift to a consultancy-led business.
