    <textOnly>Migration of NCR Vitalcast to Microsoft Azure
Last week, we notified you that we were rescheduling the migration of the NCR Vitalcast application to Microsoft Azure from the original dates we communicated.


The migration will now occur in 2 phases on Tuesday, November 9, and Wednesday, November 10. The first phase is the move to a new endpoint followed by the production environment migration to Microsoft Azure Public Cloud. Moving to the Azure Cloud Platform provides multiple benefits:


	- Improved stability and reliability for optimal performance leveraging state-of-the-art technology




	- Enhanced monitoring capabilities to proactively detect anomalies




	- Ability to scale capacity based on workload




	- Optimizes network performance, storage and database performance




	- Improves application performance by identifying bottlenecks to ensure users have the best experience




	- Provides robust capabilities with modern intelligence tools that provide detailed environment and product metrics for analysis and reporting


ACTION REQUIRED:
You will need to whitelist the NCR endpoints now to prepare for the migration, or you will be at risk of losing access to your licensed NCR product that is being migrated to Azure.

TIMING: Migration dates are November 9, 2021, and November 10, 2021. 

WHAT TO EXPECT:

On November 9, 2021, we will migrate to the new endpoint defined in the table above. There is no production downtime expected on this day. On November 10, you can expect downtime from 4PM – 7PM Eastern Time. If you have already made your firewall/whitelisting changes, there should be no impact to your software and how you use it. Sites that have not performed the necessary changes will no longer be able to post or pick up new content plans for their devices. This will not affect content plans already playing on the devices at the site, but new plans will not be delivered.


Thank you for your cooperation in whitelisting the NCR endpoints in advance to avoid any risk of losing access to your licensed NCR products once they are migrated to Cloudflare. Please contact NCR Customer Support if you have any questions or experience any issues, so we can assist you as quickly as possible.
