    <subject>Our NCR community is here to support you</subject>
    <textOnly>To our customers,

The protests happening throughout the United States are spurring important discussions about racism and injustice. We are taking important steps to examine the ways we treat our neighbors and how we can better support each other. While tragedy was the catalyst, I believe we will emerge stronger and more empathetic.

Yesterday, our CEO Mike Hayford sent a note to the NCR community &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/company/responding-to-injustice-as-one-global-community]]&gt; that we want to share. Our company is global, diverse and inclusive, but we know that simply having a diverse workforce is not enough. Change starts with our leadership team and requires action.

I hope you’ll take a moment to read Mike’s letter and know that we are proud to call you our customer. We stand ready to support the hospitality industry as one NCR team.

Regards,
Dirk Izzo
