Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

At NCR, we are focused on the success of our customers. 

Your feedback on our annual Customer Satisfaction survey helps us learn how we can help you succeed and define where we can simplify, innovate and provide you greater business value. 

Soon, you will receive our 2020 survey. I encourage you to take the survey and let us know how weâ€™re doing. Your feedback is more valuable than ever in the current environment.

Improving the customer experience is at the core of our vision and strategy, and your insights help us make this possible. 

I look forward to hearing your feedback. Thank you again for being a customer of NCR.

My best,</textOnly>
