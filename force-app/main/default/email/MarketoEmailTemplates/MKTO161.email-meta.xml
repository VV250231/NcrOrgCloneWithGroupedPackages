What would you do if you knew that 20% of consumers were up for grabs from your competition?

According to a new NCR survey, 1 in 5 consumers say they will change where and how they shop due to COVID-19 factors. The opportunity is there, but are you prepared?

Register now for our grocery experience webinar 
with industry analyst firm IHL and leading grocery retailers.

We’ll help you decode the post-COVID shopper, how to serve them and what to do next.

Plus, you’ll get market insights from IHL, discuss predictions and hear first-hand from two NCR grocery customers about what they’re doing to exceed shopper expectations.
