    <textOnly>The rise of digital payment preferences is real, but cash is still an important payment choice.

You only need to look at the high cash-in-circulation levels over the last year to see that cash remains the go-to 
during a crisis. And the control, privacy, ease and immediacy of cash payments means it will always be a preferred choice.
