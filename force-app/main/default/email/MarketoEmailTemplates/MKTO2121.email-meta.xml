    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Thank you for taking the time to visit the NCR team at our booth during the ATMIA 2023 event in 
New Orleans!

I hope you enjoyed the conference sessions and had the opportunity to learn about the new and exciting changes occurring in our industry.

NCR showcased our ATM Solutions Suite at this year’s event. These solutions provide a secure and holistic yet flexible approach to ATM distribution strategy, powering physical customer engagement — not just at the branch but everywhere your customers may be. 

We also hope you were able to catch Don Layden’s session — Innovating Outside the Box — on the final day of the conference!

If you have any questions for the NCR team, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Even better, come and visit our Customer Experience Center at our Atlanta HQ for an in-depth look at our newest innovations! Reach out to your account executive to schedule a visit.

Regards,

The NCR Team
