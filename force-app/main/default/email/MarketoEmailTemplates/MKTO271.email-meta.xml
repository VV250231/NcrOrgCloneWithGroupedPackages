    <textOnly>Recently NCR teamed up with ATMIA to explore how the events of 2020 have impacted ATM security trends.

We presented the findings of this survey at the ATMIA US Security Event. In case you missed it, we wanted to share our presentation and key findings that cover:


	- 

Impacts of COVID-19 on ATM use across the globe

	- 

Changes in common ATM attacks

	- 

Increases in ATM vandalism

	- 

Acceleration in contactless transactions to prevent fraud
