    <subject>To Our Indiana Customers</subject>
    <textOnly>To our valued NCR restaurant customers in Indiana: 

We know you have an important decision to make. NCR is here to help.  

With Governor Holcomb announcing that restaurants and bars that serve food may open May 11 at 50% capacity, ultimately, it’s your choice when you reopen your 
restaurant. We’ll support you whenever you decide to fully reopen. We can consult on any changes you want to make to your operations and ensure your technology is ready. 

As you make your plans, give us a call at 765-778-4080 or email inky.support@ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:inky.support@ncr.com]]&gt;, and let us know how we can help, including:


	- If you need to change your floor plans
	- If your NCR Aloha technology was turned off while you were closed
	- If you were experiencing any issues with your technology prior to closing
	- And anything else you think we can help you with.



Our team would be happy to conduct a full Aloha health check to help you get ready to reopen. If there are any issues, we’ll work with you to resolve them. If you would like to get a start on checking your systems, you can:


	- Validate your internet is working on your back of house computer
	- Sign in to Aloha Manager
	- Sign in to every terminal
	- Print something on every printer



We also have additional resources available for you and your staff:


	- Free online Aloha training &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/restaurants/alohapos-training]]&gt; for your managers and staff
	- Hardware cleaning guidelines &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/cleaning-ncr-hardware]]&gt;
	- Smooth application process for the Payroll Protection Program &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/nymbus-smb-relief]]&gt;
	- Digital marketing recommendations and sample social media and email graphics &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/restaurants/marketingtoolkit]]&gt;
	- Access to additional articles &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/restaurants/3-ways-to-drive-revenue-and-engage-with-customers-while-diningroom-is-closed]]&gt; on contactless payments and delivery, takeout and curbside operations and more.



Thank you for being our customer. Together we’ll #keepcommercerunning. 



Sincerely,
