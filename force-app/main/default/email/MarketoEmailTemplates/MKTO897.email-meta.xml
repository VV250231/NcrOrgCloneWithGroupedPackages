Dear valued customer,

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to make headlines, our thoughts are with you and all restaurant operators as we work together to navigate this challenging time.  We are in this together and will provide ongoing updates and ideas for ways that you can protect your business. 


If your restaurant needs Online Ordering to support Takeout and Curbside Pickup:

As local governments have asked restaurants to close in-restaurant dining, we know supporting takeout is critical to your business.  We can quickly help you set up an online ordering site to promote your menu to loyal customers through social media and your marketing programs.  Reach out to us at 1-800-225-5627, extension 2, then 3 or hospitality.smb@ncr.com &lt;[[mailto:hospitality.smb@ncr.com]]&gt; and one of our NCR Aloha representatives can discuss options with you.



If your restaurant is shut down completely, please also call us and we can help.
 

We recognize that these are uncertain times.  We’ve also been working with the government and have created additional resources below for you on ncr.com:




	- Keeping Your Employees Safe - Even as you transition to takeout and delivery, it’s important to keep certain areas in your restaurant clean – and that includes your NCR touchscreen technology. Best practices can be found here &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/cleaning-ncr-hardware]]&gt;. 




	- SMB Government Programs to Help Your Business - The U.S. government is working on a set of new programs for small and medium-sized businesses from small business loans to new sick leave requirements and refundable tax credits. We have set up an informational hub &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus]]&gt; with information on these programs &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/federal-disaster-response-stimulus]]&gt; and will continue to update this regularly.



If you have any questions or would like to consult with us on how to navigate through these challenging times, please do not hesitate to reach out.  We are here for you and will be by your side every step of the way.
