    <subject>RSVP Today - Digital Branch Evolution Webinar</subject>
    <textOnly>Date: Tuesday, June 1st at 2 pm KSA (GST-1)
Going virtual is not new, but the capabilities of being virtual continue to improve rapidly.

Just a few years ago, digital branches delivered little more for a financial institution than a branding presence—offering simple transactions, digital branches could fulfill just 60-75% of customer transactions at the branch.

Since then, advances in both technology and customer acceptance have transformed the digital branch to provide efficient full-service delivery at reduced costs. 

Join us to discuss the drivers for digital branches and the key role they play in retail and business banking service delivery. 
 
Join us on Tuesday, June 1st at 2pm KSA (GST -1).
