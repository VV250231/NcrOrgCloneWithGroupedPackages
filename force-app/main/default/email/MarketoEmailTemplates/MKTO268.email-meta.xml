    <subject>Self-service Doesn’t Mean NO Service, Right?</subject>
    <textOnly>Self-checkout is so much more than the equipment at {{company.Company Name:default=your store}}’s front end. It’s about choice, safety and helping COVID-era customers get in and out fast.

But it’s also about better service. Because you can reallocate associates to tasks that provide a personal shopping experience while offering a speedier checkout.

Watch how NCR self-checkout helped a popular independent grocer improve their customer service.
