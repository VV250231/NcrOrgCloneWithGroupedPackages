    <subject>NCR transformed Mach 1’s shopping experience</subject>
    <textOnly>NCR assessed Mach 1’s goals and implemented the 
right technology to improve their customer experience. With consumer behaviors shifting, Mach 1 needed to deploy self-service solutions to meet the demands of their shoppers and stay competitive in the market.

Now, self-service checkout processes about 50% of Mach 1’s transactions (excluding pay-at-the-pump purchases). This deployment allows their associates more time to focus on engaging with shoppers and addressing inventory needs.

What happened next? A better store performance overall!

Check out the customer story below to learn how NCR impacted Mach 1’s stores.
