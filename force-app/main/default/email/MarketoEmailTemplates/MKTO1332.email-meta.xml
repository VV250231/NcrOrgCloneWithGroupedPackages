    <subject>NGA 2022: Join NCR to see where grocery retail is headed</subject>
    <textOnly>It’s no secret that grocery eCommerce has and 
continues to surge to an all-time high. The trend is here to stay. In fact, online grocery sales leaped 54% over the past 2 years &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/blogs/retail/grocery-shoppers-going-digital]]&gt; – an increase of more than $30 billion. To deliver the ultimate customer satisfaction, you must provide exceptional self-service options and the flexibility to let your customers shop how they want, when and where they want. 

Join NCR at NGA 2022 in Booth #1219. We’ll be showcasing two of our latest technology advancements: 
NCR Freshop, our eCommerce platform solution is designed specifically for grocers and can be ramped up in weeks. Plus our market-leading Self-Checkout Solutions, which improve front-end efficiency, staff 
productivity and inventory management while enabling your customers to shop the way they want.

We’re looking forward to seeing you there!
