    <subject>How will a 23% increase in cash impact you?</subject>
    <textOnly>We&apos;re excited to invite you to NCR&apos;s latest 
webinar on how the changing financial landscape in India is poised to impact your day-to-day operations — and how to turn these changes into opportunities.

Join us Wednesday, July 28th at 3 p.m. (IST).

With experts predicting a 23% rise in demand for cash and 17 billion withdrawals in India by 2025, now is the time to explore more ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs and increase revenues.


	- 
Is there a way to shift the burden of day-to-day 
operations?

	- 
Are you getting the maximum out of your self-serve 
channel?

	- 
With interchange fees increasing, how can banks maximize potential revenue 
generations?

	- 
As regulations change, how can self-service technology bridge the gap to the underbanked? 




Our panel of experts will address these questions and discuss the technology solutions that can help 
you improve your cash handling and save money.
