The path to success starts with contextual data and deeper user segmentation. 

Join Ned Tobey, NCR Digital Banking, and special guests Wade Arnold, BillGO, and Todd Wooten, Redstone Federal Credit Union, as they share their expertise and firsthand experiences, plus:



	- How FinTech companies are enabling hyper-personalization for financial institutions
	- Where personalization is heading
	- Insights from industry experts who have achieved success with digital personalization
