    <subject>Update About our NCR 2020 Innovation Conference</subject>
    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Dear Customer}}, it’s been an unusual year for {{company.Company Name:default=your financial institution}}, your customers—and NCR, too.

As a result of the coronavirus, many 
in-person events have been canceled, and, due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, that unfortunately includes our 2020 Innovation Conference.

Currently, we’re working on plans for our 2021 event, which could be in-person, virtual or a combination, depending on health and safety guidelines moving forward.

We’ll keep you updated on our progress, and we look 
forward to sharing the evolution of technology designed for today’s new normal in banking.

In this environment, the spotlight is on digital– so for ideas, innovations and strategies, visit NCR.com/blogs for resources on everything from free digital marketing toolkits &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/banking/free-digital-banking-awareness-campaign-kit]]&gt;, case studies on Digital banking &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/banking/powerful-digital-solutions-when-theyre-needed-most]]&gt;, and our Interactive Tellers &lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/coronavirus/banking/delivering-service-with-a-smile-they-can-actually-see-remotely]]&gt; to adding antimicrobial
