    <textOnly>Unlock {{company.Company Name:default=your store}}&apos;s true potential 
with a software-defined approach
&lt;[[https://www.ncr.com/retail/software-defined-store/unlock-potential]]&gt;
Many retail tech leaders get into the business to focus on innovation—but end up spending a lot of time on routine maintenance and support. Wouldn’t it be great to:




	- 

Put the right tech in your associates’ hands so they can make a real difference (instead of tying them to single-purpose hardware)


	- 

Roll out new shopping experiences for customers—too fast for your competitors to keep up with


	- 

Upgrade software and hardware independently—when it makes sense, and not because of some vendor’s end of life schedule?


	- 

Show your CEO some amazing numbers—that you’ve lowered the “tech cost curve”, so you’re getting more out of your tech for less?



Would it mean you could focus on that elusive “strategic innovation” instead of spending all your time on routine IT? We sure think so.
