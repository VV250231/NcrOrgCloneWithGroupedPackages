    <subject>3 Unexpected Strategies—Just in Time for Peak Season</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},


Peak season is coming in hot. Given the impacts of COVID-19, this season will be crucial to profitability.

Is your store IT ready?

Based on what I know about your business at {{company.Company Name:default=your store}}, I think we have some exciting ways to help:



	- 

Deploy your hardware at speed &amp; scale, especially because of COVID-19 constraints

	- 

Protect shoppers and associates with our anti-microbial service

	- 

Serve as your one-stop shop for Zebra procurement, deployment and maintenance (And not just NCR equipment; we’ve partnered with Zebra in a bigger way than ever before.)



This peak season is gearing up to be one like we’ve never experienced. Let’s make it a success by helping you quickly adapt to this new normal. 

Can we find some time next week for a brief chat? 

Thanks!</textOnly>
