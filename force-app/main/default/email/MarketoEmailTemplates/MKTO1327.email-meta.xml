    <subject>ATM as a Service will be crucial in 2022. Here’s why.</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 

We hope 2022 is off to a great start for you and your team. As financial institutions rethink strategies and work on new ways to maximize efficiencies, we have a solution to make things easier. 

There are so many different things to keep on top of when it comes to running the ATM channel.

You need to not only manage the day-to-day maintenance, security updates, cleaning and cash levels, but also vendors, fleet performance and the long-term strategy for the channel. 

With around 60 million transactions taking place at Wells Fargo ATMs each month – ensuring high availability, modernized infrastructure and security of both the ATM and your customers’ data is vital. 

ATM as a Service is an outsourcing model that large financial institutions around the world are starting to adopt with great success. It allows you to hand the complexities of running your ATMs to a strategic partner. We have the experience, expertise and boots on the ground to make your ATM channel everything you need it to be.

Explore the benefits of outsourcing your entire ATM channel in our blog.
