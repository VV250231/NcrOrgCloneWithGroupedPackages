    <subject>Customer Success: NCR Freshop + Northgate Markets</subject>
    <textOnly>The largest Hispanic supermarket chain in the U.S., 
Northgate Market, needed to launch curbside pickup during the pandemic, but didn’t have online ordering. 

They also needed to keep things in-house and had to beat premium delivery service pricing to stay competitive.

The solution: With the help of NCR Freshop, they gave customers a new way to shop, via Pronto! Curbside and took advantage of new insights that gave them a deep dive into store and shopper activity.
