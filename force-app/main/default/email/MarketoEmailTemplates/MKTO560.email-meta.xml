    <textOnly>These days, more safety starts with less contact. 87% of consumers want contactless payment options as part of a “safer restaurant experience.” 

And restaurants need to deliver that safety without slowing down service.

Now, you can do both—and more—with Aloha OrderPay, our new handheld POS. 

Your servers can take orders and payments at the table, patio, bar and curb. And your guests don’t have to hand over their payment card and wait for it to be returned.

It means a safer, contactless experience for them. And increased speed, accuracy and revenue for you.
