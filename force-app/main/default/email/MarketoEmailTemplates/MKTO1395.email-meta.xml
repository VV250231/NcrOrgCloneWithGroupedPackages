    <subject>Will we get to meet you at the CRB Show?</subject>
    <textOnly>We’re excited to be a part of the 
action at the Colorado Restaurant and Bar Show this year. As a tech company, we’ll be showcasing our solutions that help you run your restaurants with ease. Starting at $0 per month, our starter package has everything you need from email marketing to POS to payment processing.

If you’re attending the show, stop and see us at Booths 327 &amp; 329. We’ve worked with local restaurants in Colorado like Snooze Eatery and Tokyo Joe’s to increase their sales, kitchen capacity and helped grow 
their business. 

If you aren’t able to attend the show, we’d still love to set up some time to stop by your restaurant, catch up and see if we can help you in any way. How about we grab 15 minutes next week?

Sincerely,

NCR Hospitality
