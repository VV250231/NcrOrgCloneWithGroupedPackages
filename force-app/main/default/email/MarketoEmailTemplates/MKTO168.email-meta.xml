    <subject>Important update for NCR Vision 2.x</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer,
 


As a valued NCR client and partner, we continue to strive to ensure that our solutions provide maximum value to you and your customers.

As you know, NCR has previously advised of Adobe’s decision to discontinue the browser support of Flash Player, which is used in NCR’s Vision 2.x/3.x solution.  We have previously recommended you migrate to Vision 4 for this reason and for the enhanced value that Vision 4 delivers.  This continues to be the goal state.

We have learned that Adobe has recently and unexpectedly, disabled the ability for older browsers to support Flash. Hence, running Adobe under an older browser will now no longer be effective as a short-term work around in 2021.  We must plan an alternative route together to ensure your system remains operational in 2021.
 
 NCR has worked with a third party to provide a supported browser to extend support for Adobe Flash for 2021 only. Your NCR account manager will be contacting you with the specific details to address this situation and ensure a smooth transition path forward.  Together, we need to move quickly.  We ask this be a priority when the NCR team directly reaches out to ensure continued use of your Vision system.
 
 Thank you for being a valued customer and we look forward to working with you to a quick a successful resolution of this issue.
 
 Kind Regards,

Terry Duffy
 Senior Vice President
