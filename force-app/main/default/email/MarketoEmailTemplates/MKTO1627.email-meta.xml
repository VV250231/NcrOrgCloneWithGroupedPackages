    <subject>NCR transformed Mach 1’s shopping experience</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

NCR assessed Mach 1’s goals and implemented the right technology to improve their customer experience. With consumer behavior shifting, Mach 1 needed to deploy self-service solutions to meet shoppers’ demands and to stay competitive in the market.

Now, self-service checkout processes about 50% of Mach 1’s transactions (excluding pay-at-the-pump purchases). This deployment means that their associates have more time to focus on engaging with shoppers and addressing inventory needs.

The result? A better store performance overall!

Check out the customer story below to learn how NCR impacted Mach 1’s stores.
