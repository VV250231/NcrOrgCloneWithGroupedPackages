    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
 
Late last year, we conducted our NCR Customer Satisfaction Survey 2022, with many of our customers participating and sharing their opinion with us. We continue to use that feedback as a foundation for how we learn, improve and make working with us simpler. Creating a unified customer-first support and service experience has been one of the top priorities in our strategy — all to keep our customers satisfied and grow together as we transform the markets that we serve. 

I am excited to let you know we saw significant improvement in the overall survey results for the fourth consecutive year, particularly in our Net Promoter Score (NPS). 

At the same time, we know there is always an opportunity for improvement. Based on the responses we received, we are focusing on the following categories and actions within the NCR Retail business:


	- Communication — We are investing in our people and streamlining processes to improve your experience in every aspect of your interactions with NCR. These structural improvements will increase accountability and single points of contact for our customers. No matter your need, we will focus on improvements to keep you informed.
	- Onboarding and support — To help improve how we develop, demonstrate and deliver our software, we remain focused on advancing our agile processes. Our onboarding playbooks will provide well-defined phase gates to enable clear expectations, focused outcomes and timely implementations. We heard your feedback on breaking down silos and delivering on commitments. It is our goal to focus on incident reduction and problem management in support operations.
	- Product lifecycle management — We will provide important updates on the product lifecycle and innovations as we work closely with our customers. To better understand your needs, we have continuous quality feedback loops. We will continue to improve automation and integration testing across our products to help you run your store.


As always, thank you for being an NCR customer and sharing your opinion with us. We look forward to making further improvements and continuing to hear from you.

Respectfully,

David Wilkinson 
President and General Manager
NCR Retail
