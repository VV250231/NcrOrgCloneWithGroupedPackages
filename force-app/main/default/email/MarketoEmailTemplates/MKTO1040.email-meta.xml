    <subject>CORRECTION: 2021 TechFest Invitation</subject>
    <textOnly>This morning, you were mistakenly included on an email invitation to an NCR employee event. We’re sorry for any confusion this has caused. If you have registered to attend the TechFest event from the previous email, we will follow up with you on other opportunities that will be available to you in November and December to learn more about upcoming new features and products.

Thank you for your understanding.

Your NCR Team
