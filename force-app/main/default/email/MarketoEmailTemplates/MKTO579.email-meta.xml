    <subject>One Way to Fight Fluctuating Fuel Prices</subject>
    <textOnly>At {{company.Company Name:default=your}} stores, you’re likely seeing the effects of pandemic safety demands from your customers.

Because safety is the new loyalty. So is technology.

At NCR, we’ve got fresh ways for you to offer both—and drive more revenue, which is key in a time of fluctuating fuel profits.

With OPTIC, you can engage your consumers at the pump with enticing, personalized and loyalty-driven offers for foodservice. And you can make it super convenient with our OPTIC Grab &amp; Go App.

Now your customers can fill up their tank, order foodservice and pay for it all right at the pump. They can opt for curbside delivery or go inside to pick up…where you can encourage additional in-store sales.

It’s safety. It’s supercharged convenience. And it fights fraud, too.
