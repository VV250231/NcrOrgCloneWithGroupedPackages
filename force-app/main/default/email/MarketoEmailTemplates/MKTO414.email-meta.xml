Rise of Ghost Kitchens: Pros and Cons
The proliferation of contactless technology - mobile pay, delivery apps - in combination with consumer concerns about safety, are among the many factors contributing to the surge in online delivery to the tune of $45 billion this year alone. As restaurant operators adapt their business models to support this trend, many are exploring ghost kitchens and other delivery options as a cost-effective alternative to help them remain competitive.

facilities use to drive customer experience and revenue.” Share this article with your customers to help them decide if a ghost kitchen is the right strategy to expand their business.
