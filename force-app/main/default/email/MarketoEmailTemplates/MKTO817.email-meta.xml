    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer,

The work to integrate the DUMAC Hospitality service offering and team members into NCR’s Restaurant as a Service portfolio is ongoing. As promised, we are reaching out to notify you about an update we recently made that will impact how you contact the teams that support the servicing of your restaurants. All email addresses are now on a ncr.com domain and are provided below for your convenience. DUMAC email addresses that were previously used to contact support will be disabled on July 15th.

Please click here &lt;[[https://go.ncr.com/rs/605-BQY-740/images/Restaurant as a Service Support - W.vcf]]&gt; to download the vCard that contains the updated email address for support of the NCR Restaurant as a Service 
solution.
