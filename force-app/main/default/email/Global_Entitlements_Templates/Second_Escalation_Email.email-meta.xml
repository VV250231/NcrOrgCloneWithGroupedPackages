    <subject>URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Recovery Entitlement Found for {!Case.Account}</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Case.Account_Owner_First_Name__c}-

I have made several attempts to contact you to discuss the Entitlement possibilities for {!Case.Account}. Here’s a breakdown of the findings:

•         Name of Account - {!Case.Account}
•         Line of Business - {!Case.Industry__c}
•         Master Customer Number – {!Case.Master_Customer_Number__c}
•         Back Bill $ found – {!Case.Exception_Back_Bill__c}
•         Future Bill $ Impact – {!Case.Future_Bill_Total__c}
•         Number of Months remaining in Contract – {!Case.Months_Remaining_on_Contract__c}
•         Next billing date – {!Case.Next_Billing_Date__c}
•         Summary of issues found - {!Case.Description}

The Back Bill found is for the prior billing period. The Future Bill found is for the remainder of the contract for the customer, typically less than 36 months.

Based on these findings, we will need your attention to approve this to move forward. I am needing a response so that we can take care of {!Case.Account}. Let’s schedule to discuss this account detail on {!Case.Meeting_Date_Time_1__c}?

I look forward to speaking with you soon.




Thank you,
