    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Account_Owner_First_Name__c} -
I am reviewing {!Case.Account} and after my research, it seems that I have found possible Entitlement issues that total approximately {!Case.Potential_Recovery__c}.  I am in need of your help to address a few questions as we discuss the breakdown of the findings.  Can we schedule a meeting on {!Case.Meeting_Date_Time_1__c} or {!Case.Meeting_Date_Time_2__c}?

I look forward to speaking with you soon.
