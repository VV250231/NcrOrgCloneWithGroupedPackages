    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Account_Owner_First_Name__c} -

I haven&apos;t been able to reach you to discuss {!Case.Account} and {!Case.Potential_Recovery__c} of possible Entitlement recovery.  I would like for us to discuss the impact this has on the company as well the customer.  If we aren&apos;t able to speak by [insert the day], I will reach out to you and your manager for further assistance. I have added my supervisor to this email. If you would like to reach out to {!User.Team_Lead__c}, my supervisor, for additional assistance please feel free to do so.
