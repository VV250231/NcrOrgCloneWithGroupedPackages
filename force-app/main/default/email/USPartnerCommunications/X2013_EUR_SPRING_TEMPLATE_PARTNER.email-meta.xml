    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
Welcome to the NCR Global Interact Partner Program!  This email is a follow-up to the NCR Interact electronic contract you should have recently received.  Please find attached the NCR Interact Program Guide which is referenced in the engagement letter portion of your contract.

The contract and NAA are sent to you by email from “Spring CM eSignature” &lt;echosign@echosign.com&gt;. If you have not yet received the contract please first check your spam or junk mail folders. If you cannot locate the contract here,  please check with your IT specialist and make sure that a message from this domain will be not be rejected by your company email filters. Please then notify me at steve.lorenzen@ncr.com that you did not receive your contract and I will have it resent to you.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;

On page four of the Network Access Agreement (the last document in the agreement package), there is a link to a form to provide the name of the person within your organization who is authorized as the Portal Administrator. Please populate this form via the link and click save. This will transmit the form directly to the NCR Portal team.  

At that point, you will be transitioned to the Global Program team who will schedule a webinar to formally introduce you to the Interact Partner Program.

If you have questions, please direct them to interact.operations@ncr.com

Best Regards,

Steve Lorenzen
